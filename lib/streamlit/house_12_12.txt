WITH ME. RECEIVE US INTO YOUR PRESENCE, O GOD, AND ACCEPT OUR OFFICIAL OF
PRAISE AND THE INTENTIONS OF OUR HEARTS. FOR WE COME BEFORE YOU JUST AS WE ARE, WITH DEEP SIRES TO SERVE
YOU FAITHFULLY -- DEEP DESIRES TO SERVE YOU FAITHFULLY IN THIS PLACE FOR WHAT WE DO HAS IMPACT
ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR NEIGHBORS AS WELL AS ON THIS NATION. WITH OUR EYES ON YOU, MAY WE BE
DISINLINED TO ASSUME IT IS OUR SUCCESS, OUR INFLUENCE, OR OUR EFFORTS THAT WILL MATTER AT THE

CALLED US TO, WHEN WE ARE OBEDIENT TO OUR LAW, WHEN WE DEMONSTRATE YOUR COMPASSION,
WHEN WE HUMBLE OURSELVES TO YOUR DIVINE PLAN, OUR WORK SHOULD REVEAL YOUR IMPACT ON EACH OF US
AND YOUR POWER OVER THIS WORLD. GOD, YOU SO LOVE US THAT YOU

HERE. ENABLE US, THEN, TO BE GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANTS THAT WE MAY SHARE IN YOUR ETERNAL JOY.
IT IS THE STRENGTH OF YOUR NAME WE PRAY. AMEN.
THE SPEAKER: THE CHAIR HAS EXAMINED THE JOURNAL OF THE LAST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS AND ANNOUNCES TO THE HOUSE THE APPROVAL THEREOF. PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 1 OF RULE 1,
THE JOURNAL STANDS APPROVED. THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE WILL BE LED BY THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH
CAROLINA, MR. DAVIS. MR. DAVIS: PLEASE JOIN ME.
I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS, ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
THE SPEAKER: THE CHAIR WILL ENTERTAIN UP TO FIVE REQUESTS FOR ONE-MINUTE SPEECHES ON EACH SIDE OF THE AISLE.
FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM MONTANA SEEK RECOGNITION? >> MR. CHAIR, I ASK UNANIMOUS
CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND MY REMARKS. THE SPEAKER: WITHOUT OBJECTION,

THE HOUSE'S PASSAGE OF THE 2026 NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT EARLIER THIS WEEK. MR. DOWNING: THE 2026 NDAA
CODIFIES CRITICAL PROVISIONS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AGENDA, INCLUDING
AUTHORIZING FULL FUNDING FOR THE SENTINAL ICBM PROGRAM.
IT IS SET TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL UPGRADES TO THE LAND-BASED COMPONENT OF OUR NUCLEAR TRIAD.
I WANT TO THANK THE AIRMEN, SECURITY FORCES, EVERYONE ONE AT
THE AIR FORCE BASE IN GREAT FALL, MONTANA, FOR THEIR CONTINUED HARD WORK ON THE
INITIAL PLANNING AND CONSTRUCK PHRASES OF THIS PROJECT. NUCLEAR DETERRENCE IS THE
BEDROCK OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. AS CHINA AND RUSSIA RAPIDLY EXPAND THEIR ARSENALS AND MO
MODERNIZE THEIR MISSILE CAPABILITIES WE CANNOT FALL BEHIND. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES FOR CONTINUED
NATIONAL SUPPORT FOR SENTINAL. WITH THAT, I YIELD YIELD.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM MARYLAND SEEK RECOGNITION? MR. HOYER: I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO SPEAK OUT OF ORDER FOR ONE MINUTE.
REVISE AND EXTEND. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE MR. HOYER: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE
TO NOTE AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT OF PATRIOTISM OF ONE OF OUR FELLOW
CITIZENS. I RISE TODAY TO THANK MACKENZIE SCOTT, FORMERLY THE WIFE OF JEFF
BEZOS, FOR DONATING $15 MILLION TO BOWIE STATE UNIVERSITY. THE LARGEST SINGLE CONTRIBUTION
IN THE SCHOOL'S HISTORY. IT IS NOT ONLY MARYLAND'S OLDEST
HCBU, IT IS ONE OF OUR STATE'S FINEST HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS, PERIOD. HER GENEROUS GIFT WILL HELP MAKE BUOY STATE UNIVERSITY EVEN MORE
AFFORDABLE AND SUPPORT THE GROUNDBREAKING RESEARCH STUDENTS PRODUCE EVERY DAY.
WITH HER HISTORIC DONATIONS BUOY STATE UNIVERSITY, MORGAN STATE
UNIVERSITY, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE, MACKENZIE HAS PROVEN HERSELF TO
BE AN HONORARY MARYLANDER. AN AMERICAN WHO CARES ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE.
AN AMERICAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE, CRITICAL IMPORTANCE,
OF EDUCATION IN OUR STATE, IN OUR NATION, AND FOR OUR KIDS AND FOR OUR FUTURE.
THANK YOU, MACKENZIE SCOTT. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE
GENTLEWOMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA SEEK RECOGNITION? >> MR. SPEAKER, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR
ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND MY REMARKS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE.
MS. DEAN: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I BEGAN THIS WEEK IN MY DISTRICT AT PENN STATE ABINGTON'S NEW
COLLEGIATE RECOVERY PROGRAM WITH STUDENTS IN RECOVERY FOR DRUG OR ALCOHOL ADDICTION, OR WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECT BIDE OTHERS WITH
ADDICTION. IT'S A PLACE FOR STUDENTS TO BE IN COMMUNITY WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH PROFESSORS AND EXPERTS IN
ADDICTION AND RECOVERY. HOW I WISH EVERY SCHOOL, EVERY FAMILY WOULD HAVE SUCH AN
OPPORTUNITY. WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IN D.C.? THE PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS IN
CONGRESS ARE RIPPING THE HOPE OF RECOVERY AWAY FOR SO MANY.
SLASHING AND SHUTTERING SAMHSA, THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION.
THEIR BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL GUTTED NEARLY $1 TRILLION FROM MEDICAID. IN MY STATE, 100,000 PEOPLE
THROUGH MEDICAID HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND TO RECOVERY. THAT'S IN JEOPARDY. AND IN 19 DAYS, A.C.A. TAX
CREDITS WILL EXPIRE, SPIKING PREMIUMS OVERNIGHT. 30,000 PENNSYLVANIANS HAVE ALREADY DROPPED COVERAGE.
BY THE END OF JANUARY IT IS ESTIMATED BY MY GOVERNOR, 150,000 WILL BE WITHOUT
INSURANCE. THE STUDENTS I MET WITH ARE SO YOUNG. THEY HAVE PEOPLE AND RESOURCES ON THEIR SIDE.
I HAVE SUCH HOPE FOR THEM. WE SHOULD WANT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU. I YIELD BACK, MR. SPEAKER.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA SEEK RECOGNITION? >> MR. SPEAKER, I ASK UNANIMOUS
CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE.
>> MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO SOUND THE ALARM ON THE MILITARY
BUILDUP IN THE CARIBBEAN, EDGING US CLOSER TO A REGIME CHANGE WAR IN VENEZUELA. MR. KHANNA: THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS SENT THE GERALD FORD AIRCRAFT CARRIER, OUR LARGEST, 10% OF OUR NAVY IS
IN THE CARIBBEAN, INCLUDING DESTROYERS AND SUBMARINES. WE HAVE 15,000 TROOPS IN FLORIDA
AND PUERTO RICO, INCLUDING MARINES, READY FOR AM FISHOUS
LANDINGS AND F-35'S AND B-52'S FLYING ACROSS THE CARIBBEAN AND
VENEZUELA AIRSPACE. WE DO NOT NEED AFTER IRAQ, AFTER
LIBYA, AFTER 20 YEARS IN AFGHANISTAN, AFTER YEMEN, AND OTHER REGIME CHANGE WAR --
ANOTHER REGIME CHANGE WAR. IT'S TIME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO OPPOSE A REGIME CHANGE
WAR IN VENEZUELA. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA SEEK RECOGNITION?
>> MR. SPEAKER, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE.
MR. DAVIS: MR. SPEAKER, HERE'S THE SCOREBOARD.
IT SEEMS THE GAME OF MID DECADE REDISTRICTING IS STILL ONGOING.
I COMMEND INDIANA FOR RECOGNIZING THIS ISN'T GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY, AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY.
IT'S WRONG FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S WRONG FOR REPUBLICANS TO DRAW
MAPS MID DECADE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PUTTING UP POINTS ON THE SCOREBOARD. WHICH IS WHY I INTRODUCED THE
RESET ACT, AND CALL ON CONGRESS TO PASS IT. CONGRESS MUST RESTORE ELECTORAL
STABILITY TO ENHANCE TRUST. WITH ELECTIONS EVERY OTHER YEAR, IMAGINE ASSEMBLIES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY WAITING TO SEE THE RESULTS ONLY TO REDRAW THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS TO RUN
UP THE POINTS. THE PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER, THE PEOPLE DESERVE THE VOICES TO BE
HEARD. WE MUST PUT OUR CONSTITUENTS FIRST, STOP THE POLITICAL
GAMESMANSHIP, AND BRING THIS REDISTRICTING MADNESS TO AN END. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I YIELD BACK.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM NEW YORK SEEK RECOGNITION? >> MR. SPEAKER, I REQUEST
UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND MY REMARKS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE.
MS. GILLEN: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE
TODAY WITH GREAT PRIDE TO CONGRATULATE SOUTHSIDE HIGH SCHOOL'S GIRLS VOLLEYBALL TEAM
ON WINNING THE NEW YORK STATE CLASS A GIRLS VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.
ON BEHALF OF NASSAU COUNTY AND NEW YORK'S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, I WANT TO TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMEND AND CELEBRATE THESE YOUNG ATHLETES FOR THEIR DEDICATION, THEIR TEAMWORK, AND THEIR
PERSEVERANCE. THIS YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP MARKS SOUTHSIDE'S SECOND STATE TIGHT UNTIL PROGRAM HISTORY, AND ITS
FIRST SINCE 1993. A TESTAMENT TO THE STRONG FO
FOUNDATION BUILT BY PLAYERS AND COACHES OVER MANY, MANY YEARS. CONGRATULATIONS, CYCLONES, ON
YOUR REMARKABLE VICTORY. YOU HAVE MADE ROCKVILLE SENT
EARN NEW YORK'S FOURTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT VERY PROUD W THAT I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
CHAIR ANNOUNCES THE SPEAKER'S APPOINTMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 2-B-2 OF THE COMMISSION TO STUDY
THE POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF THE WHITESMAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY TO THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 118-144. AND THE ORDER OF THE HOUSE OF
JANUARY 3, 2025, OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS ON THE PART OF THE HOUSE TO THE COMMISSION TO STUDY THE
POTENTIAL TRANSFER OF THE WHITESMAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AMERICAN JEWISH HISTORY TO THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE CLERK: MR. PAUL PACKER OF BOCA RATON, FLORIDA, AND MOO MR,
VIRGINIA. GOLD FARB OF MCLEAN, VIRGINIA.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO, MR. LATTA, SEEK
RECOGNITION? MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 936, I CALL
UP H.R. 3668, AND ASK FOR ITS IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATION IN THE HOUSE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE CLERK WILL REPORT THE TITLE OF
THE BILL. THE CLERK: UNION CALLED NUMBER 253, H.R. 3668. A BILL TO PROMOTE INTERAGENCY
COORDINATION FOR REVIEWING CERTAIN AUTHORIZATIONS UNDER SECTION 3 OF THE NATIONAL GAS ACT, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:
PURSUANT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 936, THE BILL IS CONSIDERED AS READ. THE BILL SHALL BE DEBATABLE FOR ONE HOUR EQUALLY DIVIDED AND
CONTROLLED BY THE CHAIR AND RANKING MINORITY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE DESIGNEES.
THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO, MR. LATTA, AND THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY, MR. PALLONE, EACH WILL CONTROL 30 MINUTES.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO, MR. LATTA. MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, I ASK
UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT ALL MEMBERS MAY HAVE FIVE LEGISLATIVE DAYS TO REVISE AND EXTEND THEIR REMARKS ON THE LEGISLATION, AND TO INSERT
EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL ON H.R. 3668. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION.
MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: IS RECOGNIZED. MR. LATTA: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. OUR NATION IS -- I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. MR. SPEAKER, OUR NATION IS AT
THE CROSSROADS WHEN IT COMES TO POWERING OUR FUTURE. THIS PIVOTAL MOMENT WILL SHAPE
OUR ECONOMIC TRAJECTORY, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. AFTER YEARS OF MODEST GROWTH ON
ELECH TERRORISTITY CONSUMPTION, THE NEXT FIVE YEARS COULD SEE UPWARDS OF 120 GIGAWATTS OF NEW DEMAND.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS DEMAND GROWTH REQUIRE NEW BASE LOAD DISPATCHABLE POWER AND NATURAL
GAS WILL FILL THAT GAP. UNFORTUNATELY, THE BUILD OUT OF INTERSTATE NATIONAL GAS PIPELINE
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS PHRASE FACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. APPROVALS ARE OFTEN DELAYED DUE TO A LACK OF COORDINATION, OR
OUTRIGHT OBSTRUCTION BY STATES AND RELEVANT FEDERAL AGENCIES. SECTION 401 OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT HAS TURNED INTO A PROCEDURAL
CHOKE POINT WITH VARYING APPLICATION AND DRAWN OUT STATE REVIEWS UNDERMINING OTHERWISE
FEDERALLY AUTHORIZED PROJECTS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN ENERGY SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN AREAS OF
COUNTRY. EXPOSING CONSUMERS TO HIGH PRICES, AND OUR GRID TO INCREASE
VULNERABILITY. IN FACT, A RECENT STUDY ESTIMATED THAT PIPELINE
BLOCKADES HAVE ALREADY DRIVEN AVERAGE NATURAL GAS PRICES UP BY
160% IN MAJOR DEMAND CENTERS. ..
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE CASE. ACTIVIST STATES LIKE NEW YORK HAVE USED THEIR DELEGATED AUTHORITY UNDER SECTION 401 TO
REPEATEDLY KILL INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECTS. THESE CLEAN WATER ACT DENIALS
HAVEN'T BEEN BECAUSE OF LEGITIMATE WATER QUALITY IMPACT CONCERNS.
THE BASE OF THESE BLOCKADES HAVE BEEN IN THE NAME OF RADICAL CLIMATE AGENDAS, IGNORING WHAT IS BEST FOR CONSUMERS, GRID
RELIABILITY, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. DURING THE 2013 TO 2021 TIME
PERIOD, SEVERAL PIPELINE PROJECTS WERE CANCELED. LEADING TO A PIPELINE CAPACITY GROWTH OF ONLY 26%.
MEANWHILE, NATURAL GAS DEMAND INCREASED BY 49%. THIS TREND WILL BE COMPOUNDED IF
THERE ARE NOT STATUTORY REFORMS. H.R. 3668 WOULD STRENGTHEN THE
FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION, FERC, LEAD AGENCY'S
ROLE FOR FURTHER DEFINING THE PROCESS OF PARTICIPATING AGENCIES. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THIS LEGISLATION, INSTEAD OF HAVING
TO OBTAIN A SECTION 401 CERTIFICATION FROM A STATE THROUGH ITS E.P.A.-DELEGATED
AUTHORITY, FERC WOULD INCORPORATE THWART QUALITY REVIEW -- THIS WATER QUALITY REVIEW INTO ITS EXISTING NEPA
REVIEW WITH ANY CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY STATES. OPPONENTS ARGUE THAT THIS
LEGISLATION WILL GUT THE CLEAN WATER ACT. HOWEVER, THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T EVEN AMEND THE CLEAN
WATER ACT. IT MAINTAINS STATUTORY PROTECTIONS OF LEGITIMATE WATER QUALITY CONCERNS.
FERC ALREADY ANALYZES WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AS PART OF THE NEPA PROCESS, IMPOSES MITIGATION
MEASURES AS NEEDED, IT IS EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO RAISED CONCERNS AS PART OF THE REVIEW
PROCESS. AGAIN, NOTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION ALTERS THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF THESE
PROJECTS. EXPANDING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE CAPACITY IS ESTIMATED TO SAVE
AMERICANS $76 BILLION BY 2040. WITHOUT STATUTORY REFORM,
SECTION 401 OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT, THESE SAVINGS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, THE NATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE WITH CHINA, AND
THE INTELLIGENCE RACE, AND OUR ELECTRIC GRID WILL EXPERIENCE SERIOUS VULNERABILITIES.
I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED.
MR. PALLONE: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE
IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO H.R. 3668, THIS BILL WAS AN
OUTRIGHT ASSAULT ON OUR NATION'S ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. THEY COMPLETELY STRIP STATES OF THEIR ABILITY TO ENFORCE CLEAN
WATER LAWS WHEN IT COMES TO PIPELINES. AND I HAVE TO SAY, MR. SPEAKER, THAT I WAS SURPRISED WHETHER I
FIRST SAW THIS PROVISION OF THE BILL. I THOUGHT REPUBLICANS WERE THE PARTY OF STATES' RIGHTS.
SO SURELY THEY WOULDN'T TAKE AWAY A STATE'S RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS AND HAVE A VOICE IN
THE PIPELINE CITING PROCESS. BUT DEMOCRATS OFFERED AN AMENDMENT AT OUR COMMITTEE MARKUP THAT WOULD HAVE STRUCK
THIS PROVISION AND REPUBLICANS VOTED AGAINST IT. SO HERE WE ARE, REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR PUSHING FORWARD
LEGISLATION THAT ACTIVELY AND INTENTIONALLY SELLS OUT STATES' RIGHTS. MUCH LIKE THEIR PROMISE TO LOWER
PRICES, I GUESS THAT WAS ALSO JUST AN EMPTY CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. BUT THEIR BILL GOES EVEN FURTHER
THAN THAT. IT ALSO MAKES THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION OR FERC
RESPONSIBLE FOR FOARNSING THE CLEAN WATER ACT FOR PIPELINES. NOW -- FOR ENFORCING THE CLEAN
WATER ACT FOR PIPELINES. THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM WITH THAT. FERC HAS NO IDEA HOW TO DO THAT. AT AN ENERGY AND COMMERCE
COMMITTEE HEARING IN APRIL, WE HEARD FROM FERC THAT THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE THE STAFF EXPERTISE OR RESOURCES TO
EXECUTE THIS BILL PROPERLY. SO THIS BILL IS ALSO A BAD SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A
NONEXISTENT PROBLEM. FERC CONFIRMED FOR US THAT THEY HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN ISSUES WITH
STATE CLEAN WATER PERMITS FOR PIPELINES, BUT AS USUAL, REPUBLICANS SIMPLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE FACTS.
THE LANGUAGE SURROUNDING THE CLEAN WATER ACT IS NOT THE ONLY DEFECT WITH THIS BILL. DESPITE CLAIMING THAT THE BILL
AIMS TO IMPROVE INTERAGENCY COORDINATION FOR PIPELINE PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, THE
BILL ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES IT BY PITTING AGENCIES AGAINST EACH OTHER. INSTEAD OF LETTING FERC WORK
COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER AGENCIES AS THE PROCESS DOES NOW, THIS BILL MAKES FERC THE
ADNEVER AIR IS OF OTHER AGENCIES -- ADVERSARY OF OTHER AGENCIES BY FORCIING IT TO BREATHE DOWN
EVERY OTHER AGENCY'S NECK. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT AN EFFICIENT OR COLLABORATIVE PROCESS IN MY
OPINION. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO NOTE THAT WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE OBSESSED WITH DESTROYING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL
LAWS, IN ORDER TO SPEED UP THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE PIPELINES, THEY HAVE FAILED TO PASS BASIC LAWS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE
PIPELINES ARE SAFE. THE AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE SAFETY ACTIVITIES AT THE
PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION OR PHMSA
EXPIRED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND AT NO POINT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE REPUBLICANS PUT A BILL ON THE FLOOR THAT WOULD
RE-AUTHORIZE PIPELINE SAFETY ACTIVITIES. I GUESS THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT EITHER. INSTEAD THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO RUN
ROUGH SHOD OVER THE VERY CONCEPT OF SAFETY, REPEALING NUMEROUS RULES DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR
COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS, AND EVEN WITHDRAWING A RULE THAT WAS REQUIRED BY LAW THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP HIMSELF SIGNED. SO THIS BILL, MR. SPEAKER, AND OTHER ENERGY BILLS WE CONSIDER
THIS WEEK OUT OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, ARE NOT A SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT A PERMITTING PACKAGE.
I KNOW THE REPUBLICANS KEEP SAYING, OH, THIS IS PERMITTING REFORM. IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE.
THEY DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPAND OR IMPROVE OUR POWER GRID, DESPITE
THIS BEING A TIME WHEN OUR GRID RELIABILITY IS A GROWING THREAT. AND FOR YEARS DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CLEAR.
A PERMITTING PACKAGE IS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT REFORMS TO THE WAY WE BUILD TRANSMISSION
LINES THAT TRANSPORT ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NONE OF THESE BILLS ADDRESS THAT EITHER.
INSTEAD WE HAVE A SLATE OF BILLS THAT CUT CORNERS FOR FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE, ABOLISH STATES'
RIGHTS TO RULE OR TO HAVE A ROLE IN THE PIPELINE PROCESS, AND SERVE ABSOLUTELY NO ONE EXCEPT
THE WORST CORPORATE POLLUTERS. ALL WHILE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BLOCKS AND CANCELS NEW CLEAN ENERGY
PROJECTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO, MR. SPEAKER, THESE BILLS BASICALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON FAILED
REPUBLICAN ENERGY POLICIES THAT HAVE ALREADY DRIVEN UP ENERGY BILLS ON AMERICAN FAMILIES AND
POLLUTION IN JUST THE 10 MONTHS SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. THE PRESIDENT PROMISED TO CUT
AMERICANS' POWER BILLS IN HALF. BUT INSTEAD HE AND REPUBLICANS ARE CAUSING THEM TO SOAR.
WITH THEIR BACKWARD POLICIES AND THEIR WAR ON CHEAPER, CLEAN
ENERGY. ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE UP 13% NATIONWIDE AND CALLS THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY A HOAX.
THAT'S HOW OUT OF TOUCH THE PRESIDENT IS AND THE REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO BLINDLY FOLLOW HIM
DOWN THE PATH. SO, MR. SPEAKER, I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL AND I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS RECOGNIZED. >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AT THIS TIME I YIELD FOUR
MINUTES TO THE SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION, THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA'S NINTH DISTRICT.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA IS RECOGNIZED. >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. MY BILL, H.R. 3668, WOULD
GUARANTEE WE PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT, ENSURE WE PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, AND LOWER ENERGY
COSTS BY SPEEDING UP ENERGY PROJECTS THROUGH MUCH-NEEDED REFORMS TO THE PERMITTING OF
INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES. MR. HUDSON: THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERSTATE PIPELINES FACES
SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY AND STATUTORY HURDLES. IN FACT, IN 2024 WE PRODUCED LESS THAN HALF THE PIPELINE
MILES WE BUILT JUST FIVE YEARS AGO. OUR REGULATORY STATUTORY
PERMITTING PROCESS MUST BOTH PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND REFLECT THE URGENCY AND IMPORTANCE OF THE PROJECTED
GROWTH IN NATURAL GAS DEMAND. DESPITE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION BEING
GRANTED INCREASED AUTHORITY UNDER THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF
2005, PIPELINE PROJECT APPROVALS ARE CONSISTENTLY DELAYED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF COORDINATION
BETWEEN THE NUMEROUS AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. MY BILL WOULD MAKE THIS PROCESS
MORE EFFICIENT, BY BRINGING STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING AGENCIES, TO THE TABLE. SO CONCERNS CAN BE IDENTIFIED
EARLY IN THE PROCESS. FROM THERE, AGENCIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS WOULD PERFORM IMPORTANT
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS, WHILE COMPLYING WITH SCHEDULING ESTABLISHED BY FERC.
H.R. 3668 WOULD ALSO IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY REVIEW PROCESS, BY MOVING THAT RESPONSIBILITY FROM
THE STATES TO FERC. FOR THE PAST DECADE, A FEW STATES, ESPECIALLY THE NORTHEAST, HAVE USED THIS
FEDERALLY DELEGATED SECTION 401 AUTHORITY TO OBSTRUCT INTERSTATE
PROJECTS. THESE STATES HAVE STOOD OUTSIDE THE FERC-LED NATIONAL
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT PROCESS, AND USED THEIR SECTION 401 AUTHORITY AS A ONE-STATE
VETO OF A MULTISTATE PROJECT OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS HAS BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. MY BILL WOULD CONTINUE THE
SAFEGUARDS OF THE ENVIRONMENT. WE HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGEST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ON THE PLANET. THIS LEGISLATION PROTECTS THOSE
LAWS WHILE EXPEDITING CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WANT TO FUEL OUR NATION
FORWARD. AND IF WE WANT TO LOWER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS, WIN THE A.I. RACE AGAINST CHINA, AND STRENGTHEN
OUR POSITION AS AN ENERGY SUPERPOWER, IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A REGULATORY AND
STATUTORY PROCESS IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS COUNTRY. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO JOIN US
IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY
TIME. MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, I RESERVE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY IS
RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME.
LET ME SAY, I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL, THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH
CAROLINA, BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HE RAISED THE ISSUE OF ELECTRICITY PRICES IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE UP 13% NATIONWIDE.
JUST SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE. I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT. AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE UP 8%
NATIONWIDE SINCE A YEAR AGO. 14% IN MY HOME STATE OF NEW JERSEY. IN PART DUE TO INCREASED EXPORTS
OF LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS. BOTH OF THESE FIGURES ARE VASTLY OUTPACING INFLATION WHICH IS
ALREADY SKY-HIGH THANKS TO THE PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS AND HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING CRISIS. AND LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE THAT
REPUBLICANS AND PRESIDENT TRUMP OWN THIS AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. AND AFFORDABILITY ISN'T, AS THE
PRESIDENT SAID, A DEMOCRATIC SCAM. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT SIMILAR PACTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF
-- THAT'S IMPACTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
ENERGY AFFORDABILITY IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL. 80 MILLION AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR UTILITY
BILLS AND REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THIS BILL IS ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE. IN FACT, MR. SPEAKER, THE
REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE THIS WHOLE SITUATION WITH ELECTRICITY PRICES SO MUCH WORSE. THE BIG, UGLY BILL THEY PASSED
THIS SUMMER WILL RAISE ELECTRICITY PRICES BY OVER 61% OVER THE NEXT DECADE THANKS TO
ITS ATTACKS ON CLEAN ENERGY. AND THE PRESIDENT'S PURSUIT OF UNLIMITED L.N.G. EXPORTS WOULD
INCREASE NATURAL GAS COSTS BY OVER 50%. AND THAT'S ON TOP OF THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS HAVE ALREADY COST AMERICAN FAMILIES. SO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NO PLAN
TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO PAY THE PRICE AND THIS BILL'S ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE.
BUT AGAIN, I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME, MR. SPEAKER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES.
THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS RECOGNIZED. MR. LATTA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. JUST TO POINT SOME THINGS OUT
HERE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGES IN ELECTRICITY PRICES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THIS CHART. THIS IS FROM THE E.I.A. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TOP 12, AS
THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA POINTED OUT, ABOUT HIS
LEGISLATION, ESPECIALLY IN NEW ENGLAND, THE STATES UP THERE, BUT LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE. YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA AND
HAWAII, MAINE, MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT AND RHODE ISLAND IN THE TOP SIX. YOU LOOK AT THESE PRICES GOING UP. AND YOU ROUND UP THE TOP 12,
WHEN YOU LOOK AT VERMONT, NEW HAMPSHIRE'S ALSO IN THERE. AND NEW YORK. AND NEW JERSEY. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WHY WE HAVE
TO HAVE THIS LEGISLATION. WHEN YOU HAVE THE STATES PUSHING BACK ON TRYING TO GET THE
PIPELINES IN, AND PUSHING INTO JUST ONE TYPE OF ENERGY SOURCE, IT'S HURTING THEIR PEOPLE.
AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE EARLIER THIS YEAR THERE WAS AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT THAT THE NEW ENGLAND GOVERNORS WERE ALL
COMPLAINING THAT THEIR CITIZENS WERE GOING TO PAY 40% MORE FOR UTILITY PRICES THIS FALL.
WHY IS THAT? RIGHT HERE. AND THIS IS WHY THIS LEGISTION IS NEEDED.
AND AT THIS TIME I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE ENERGY SUBCOMMITTEE, FOR FOUR
MINUTES, FOR HIS STATEMENT. I YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR FOUR MINUTES. MR. WEBSTER: I THANK --
MR. WEBER: I THANK THE GENTLEMAN. GOSH, MR. SPEAKER. YOU KNOW, FAIRYTALES BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME, IF YOU KNOW HOW
THOSE BEGIN. WE'RE HEARING ONE OF THOSE TODAY HERE IN OUR VERY PRESENCE, SAYING THAT SOMEHOW THE BIG,
BEAUTIFUL BILL HAS CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. MR. SPEAKER, THE PLAIN AND SIMPLE FACT IS THE AMERICAN POPULATION IS GROWING.
OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING. AND NATURAL GAS ALREADY PROVIDES MORE THAN 40% OF THE ELECTRICITY
AMERICANS RELY ON EVERY DAY. AND DURING THIS TIME PERIOD,
2013 TO 2021, SEVERAL PIPELINE PROJECTS WERE CANCELED, LEADING TO A PIPELINE CAPACITY GROWTH OF
ONLY 26%. LET THAT SINK IN. MEANWHILE, NATURAL GAS DEMAND HAS INCREASED BY 49%.
DO THAT MATH. THIS TREND WILL BE COMPOUNDED IF THERE ARE NOT STATUTORY REFORMS.
IT IS ABSOLUTELY DISHONEST TO TRY TO BLAME L.N.G. ON THIS. AMERICA CAN'T RUN WITHOUT
ENERGY, MR. SPEAKER. AND LIKE IT OR NOT, A LOT OF THAT ENERGY COMES FROM NATURAL
GAS. WHEN WE STOP BUILDING PIPELINES BETWEEN 2013 AND 2021, LISTEN TO
THIS, OVER 25 MILLION HOMES WERE PUT AT RISK. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT H.R. 3668
FIXES. ...
THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATORY COMMISSION IS THE LEAD AGENCY FOR INTERSTATE,
INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES. AND IT REQUIRES OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES TO ALIGN THEIR REVIEWS WITH FERC'S
TIMELINE. IT'S WRITTEN WITH A CLEAR OBJECTIVE. REDUCING DELAYS AND IMPROVING COORDINATION.
DID I MENTION THAT AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS, THE GAS HAS BEEN NEEDED TO BE GIVEN TO A LOT MORE
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS. HERE'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T BUILD.
AGAIN, PIPELINE CANCELLATIONS PUT OVER 25 WITH AN M, MILLION
HOMES AT RISK. 25 WITH AN M MILL HOMES AT RISK.
DO THE MATH. DO THAT MATH. WITH THE AVERAGE HOME 3.15
PERSON IN THAT HOUSEHOLD, THAT'S NEARLY 79, AGAIN M, WITH A
MILLION, 79 MILLION PEOPLE AFFECTED. THAT DOESN'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR,
MR. SPEAKER, FOR HIGHER PRICES OR THE HIT TO OUR ENERGY SECURITY.
THE ACTUAL -- POSSIBILITY OUR ENERGY SECURITY WILL BE DAMAGED
SEVERELY. MR. SPEAKER, IF WE WANT RELIABLE POWER AND LOWER COSTS, WE'VE GOT
TO STOP TELLING FAIRY TALES AND START DOING. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MY FRIEND
AND COLLEAGUE, CONGRESSMAN HUDSON'S BILL DOES. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT T MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK.
MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY.
MR. PALLONE: I RESERVE AT THIS TIME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: ALSO RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS RECOGNIZED. MR. LATTA: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. AT THIS TIME I YIELD TWO MINUTES FROM THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA'S 12TH DISTRICT. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES. >> I THANK MR. LATTA FOR
YIELDING. MR. SPEAKER, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 3668.
MY ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN HARD AT WORK THIS YEAR CRAFTING
COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION -- LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR BURDENSOME FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS. MR. ALLEN: THE BILL BEFORE US
TODAY IS ONE EXAMPLE. DUE TO UNCLEAR REVIEW PROCESSES
AND LACK OF COORDINATION AMONGST GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, PIPELINE APPROVALS IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED IN
MANY CASES. OFTEN RESULTING IN INSUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO TRANSPORT OUR
CLEAN NATURAL GAS. THE RESULT IS AN ELECTRIC GRID THAT'S LESS RELIABLE AND
INCREASED UTILITY PRICE FORCE HARDWORKING AMERICANS. WHILE NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO REACH AN ALL TIME
HIGH, ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 40% OF ELECTRIC GENERATION IN THE U.S. NEXT YEAR, THIS IS CLEARLY A PRESSING ISSUE THAT
MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY. H.R. 3668 IS THE ANSWER.
THIS LEGISLATION BOLSTERS RULE AS THE LEAD AGENCY IN THE
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE REVIEW PROCESS EMPOWERING THEM TO OVERSEE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AGENCIES AND STREAMLINE PIPELINE
REVIEWS SO AMERICANS CAN ACCESS THE ENERGY THEY NEED ON A DAILY BASIS. THE BUILDOUT OF INTERSTATE
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ESSENTIAL TO
ENSURING DOMESTIC ENERGY CAN BE SUPPORTED -- TRANSPORTED EFFICIENTLY AND MEETING GROWING
ELECTRICITY DEMANDS. H.R. 3668 SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE FOR MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE AISLE. I YIELD BACK.
MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. MR. PALLONE: MR. SPEAKER, I'D
LIKE TO YIELD NOW SUCH TIME AS HE MAY CONSUME TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO, MR. LANDSMAN, A
MEMBER OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. LANDSMAN: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.
THANK YOU, RANKING MEMBER PALLONE. IT'S SIMPLE, THE BILL WEAKENS
STATES RIGHTS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE CLEAN WATER.
IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS, LOOK, WE ARE GOING TO SEND THESE PIPELINES THROUGH YOUR COMMUNITIES, THROUGH YOUR
STATES, AND WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOU.
WE DON'T WANT YOU TO RAISE OBJECTIONS EVEN IF IT IS AROUND
THE QUALITY OF WATER. THE QUALITY OF AIR. IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IT DOESN'T
FUNDAMENTALLY ADDRESS THE LARGER ISSUE OR BIG ISSUE OF THE RISING
COSTS OF ENERGY. ANTI-IMPACT THAT THE GLOBAL TRADE -- AND THE IMPACT THE
GLOBAL TRADE WARS THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS PURSUED HAS HAD ON THE RISING COSTS OF
UTILITY BILLS. FOR THIS REASON AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WILL OFFER A MOTION TO RECOMMIT THIS BILL
BACK TO COMMITTEE. IF THE HOUSE RULES HAD PERMITTED, I WOULD HAVE OFFERED
AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A REPORT
HOW THIS ADMINISTRATION'S ILLEGAL TARIFFS, THESE TRADE WARS, HAVE RAISED PRICES ON
ELECTRICITY AND GAS. THE JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE ESTIMATES THAT FAMILIES HAVE
ALREADY PAID $1,200 MORE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE TARIFFS.
THE TARIFFS ANTI-TRADE WARS HAVE JACKED UP PRICES AND THAT
INCLUDES ENERGY PRICES. WE NEED ACCOUNTABILITY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW HOW MUCH THIS IS COSTING
THEM SO THAT THEY CAN PUSH ON US TO END THIS -- THESE TRADE WARS
AND THE HIGH COST OF LIVING, INCLUDING ENERGY COSTS. I ASK FOR UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO
INSERT INTO THE RECORD THE TEXT OF THIS AMENDMENT, AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN ME IN
VOTING FOR THE MOTION TO RECOMMIT. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. LANDSMAN: I YIELD BACK. MR. PALLONE: I RESERVE.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO. MR. LATTA: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.
AT THIS TIME I YIELD TWO MINUTES FROM OHIO'S 12TH DISTRICT. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO
MINUTE >> THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN LATTA. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE
INTERAGENCY COORDINATION FOR PIPELINE REVIEWS ACT. MR. BALDERSON: LEGISLATION THAT WILL BRING MUCH NEED READ FORMS
TO THE FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS. NATURAL GAS HAS BECOME THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICA'S ENERGY
MIX. ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST 40% OF OUR TOTAL ENERGY PRODUCTION AND 43%
OF ELECTRICITY GENERATION. THE SHALE REVOLUTION HAS USHERED
IN A NEW ERA OF AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENTS -- INDPENCE AND
REVITAL -- INDEPENDENCE AND REVITALIZED COMMUNITIES ACROSS OHIO AS THEY TOO INTO THE
NATURAL GAS RESERVE ACROSS OUR FEET. TO MOVE THIS FROM THE WELL PAD TO THE CUSTOMER WE NEED MODERN
RELIABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BEST WAY TO TRANSPORT NATURAL GAS FROM POINT A TO B IS
BY PIPELINE. IT IS SAFER, MORE EFFICIENT, AND CHEAPER FURTHER REDUCING COSTS FOR CONSUMERS.
BECAUSE OF THE OUTDATED REGULATIONS, A LACK OF COORDINATION, AND POLITICAL
OBSTRUCTION CRITICAL PIPELINES THAT PROVIDE RELIABLE ENERGY FOR
OUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN DELAYED OR BLOCKED ALL TOGETHER. THE TRUTH IS, AMERICA'S POWER DEMAND IS SURGING, TO MEET THIS
CHALLENGE AND POWER THE FUTURE WE NEED PIPELINES THIS LEGISLATION STREAMLINES
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, ESTABLISHES CLEAR TIMELINES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS, AND HELPS LOWER COSTS FOR AMERICAN
FAMILIES BY UNLEASHING OUR FULL ENERGY POTENTIAL. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.
I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: MR. SPEAKER, I ONCE
AGAIN RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I KEEP
HEARING FROM MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ABOUT PERMITTING REFORM. IN FACT, THEY HAVE BEEN CALLING
THIS PERMITTING WEEK HERE IN THE HOUSE. THE REALITY IS, THEY ARE NOT
INTERESTED IN ANY KIND OF PERMITTING REFORM UNLESS IT INVOLVES STREAMLINING THE
ABILITY TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS FOR FOSSIL FUELS.
FOR GAS PIPELINES, FOR EXAMPLE. THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN DEALING WITH PERMITTING REFORM IN
GENERAL THAT PERHAPS WOULD HELP BRING CLEAN SOURCES OF ENERGY TO
THE PUBLIC. I WOULD LIKE TO BUILD MORE -- HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR
CLEAN ENERGY, FOR RENEWABLES. AND WE CAN CERTAIN WORK ON PERMITTING REFORM IN THAT
REGARD. BUT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T WANT THAT. THE PRESIDENT SAYS THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY WINDMILLS,
THERE SHOULDN'T BE SOLAR PANELS, THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY RENEWABLES AT ALL. THE ONLY THING HE WANTS TO DO IS
GO BACK TO FOSSIL FUELS. OIL, GAS, AND COAL. WHEN I HEAR ABOUT PERMITTING
REFORM ON THE OTHER SIDE, I KIND OF LAUGH BECAUSE WE COULD BE
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE REPUBLICANS ON PROPOSALS THAT WOULD LOWER THE COSTS OF ENERGY
AND UNLEASH DOMESTIC CLEAN ENERGY AND PERMITTING REFORM IN
AN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE BARRIERS TO CLEAN ENERGY COULD BE ON THE TABLE. THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
INSTEAD OF PROTOESALS TO MAKE THINGS BETTER, REPUBLICANS ARE
OFFERING NAILS WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CLEAN BEEN -- BILLS THAT WOULD DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CLEAN
ENERGY. DEMAND ALL COAL PLANTS STAY ON LINE PAST THEIR RETIREMENT DATE, AND THIS BILL WHICH WOULD STRIP
STATES OF THEIR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THEIR CLEAN WATER LAWS ON GAS PIPELINES. INSTEAD OF DOING WHAT I WOULD
CONSIDER THE HARD WORK TO FIND A BIPARTISAN PATH FORWARD, REPUBLICANS ARE SIMPLY GIVING UP.
I THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY DAMAGING TO THE HOUSE AS AN INSTITUTION.
REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH DEMOCRATS HERE AND IN THE SENATE, AND WE COULD HAVE ALL WORKED TOGETHER TO FIND
A PATH FORWARD. INSTEAD BULLIED INTO SUBMISSION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE MAGAS, REPUBLICANS ARE MOVING
BILLS WITH NO DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT AND ARE CUTTING THE HOUSE ENTIRELY OUT OF ANY DISCUSSIONS
WITH REGARD TO PERMITTING REFORM. IT'S A SHAME. INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING BILLS THAG
THIS BILL, THAT ESSENTIAL POLLUTES OUR WATERS, WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING LEGISLATION THAT
WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO PLAN, PERMIT, AND PAY FOR AN EXPANSION OF THE POWER GRID AND A LOT
COULD BE BASED ON CLEAN ENERGY. INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING THIS LEGISLATION, WE SHOULD BE DISCUSSING WAYS TO REINSTATE THE
MILLIONS IN GRANTS AND LOANS THAT WERE APPROVED BY CONGRESS THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ILLEGALLY CUT OFF DURING THE
REPUBLICAN SHUTDOWN. INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING THIS AWFUL BILL TODAY, WE COULD BE
DISCUSSING PROPOSALS TO GRANT CERTAINTY TO ENERGY DEVELOPERS SO THE PRESIDENT CAN'T JUST
ARBITRARILY CANCEL A WIND OR SOLAR PROJECT JUST BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS, WHICH IS WHAT HE SAYS ALL THE
TIME. THERE'S A LOT WE COULD BE DOING WITH REGARD TO TRYING TO BRING
MORE ENERGY TO MARKET. INCLUDING CLEAN ENERGY. BUT WE ARE NOT DOING THOSE
THINGS. INSTEAD, WE ARE HERE DISCUSSING PARTISAN REPUBLICAN BILL THAT STRIPS STATES OF THEIR RIGHTS
AND IS GOING NOWHERE. THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS, I GUESS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY
TIME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS RECOGNIZED.
MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, AT THIS TIME I YIELD THREE MINUTES TO THE GENTLELADY FROM NORTH
DAKOTA, THE AT-LARGE REPRESENTATIVE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLELADY IS RECOGNIZED.
MISS IF A DOOR CHICK: I TERRORIZE -- MRS. FEDORCHAK: I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF H.R.
3868. THE TRUTH IS INTERSTATE NATURAL
GAS PIPELINES ARE WHAT KEEP OUR LIGHTS ON, OUR SHOWERS HOT, AND
PRICES REASONABLE. TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY'S POINT, INTERSTATE
PIPELINES ALSO HAVE PROVIDED THE LARGEST DECREASE IN EMISSIONS IN OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY HAVE MADE
IT POSSIBLE TO DELIVER BY BACKING UP ALL OF THE RENEWABLES THAT ARE ON THE SYSTEM.
LOOK, OVERNIGHT LOWS THIS WEEKEND IN MY STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA ARE FORECASTED TO BE 20
BELOW ZERO. HAVING HEAT PROVIDED BY NATURAL GAS IS LITERALLY THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN COMFORT AND CHAOS. AND YES, BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
IN STATES LIKE MINE. IF WE WANT AFFORDABLE AND DEPENDABLE ENERGY IN OUR
COUNTRY, THEN WE MUST BILL THE -- BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DELIVERS IT, TOO OFTEN
THESE PROJECTS ARE DELAYED OR BLOCKED BY A FEDERAL PERMITTING PROCESS THAT IS FAR TOO
INCONSISTENT. WHEN ONE STATE CAN DERAIL AN INTERSTATE PIPELINE, ENTIRE
REGIONS PAY THE PRICE. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS TIME AGAIN IN THE NORTHEAST.
IN THE NORTHEAST SHORTAGES HAVE ALREADY THREATENED RELIABILITY AND DRIVEN PRICES THROUGH THE
ROOF. THIS BILL BRINGS LONG OVERDUE ACCOUNTABILITY AND COORDINATION TO THE FEDERAL PERMITTING
PROCESS FOR INTERSTATE NATURAL GAS PIPELINES. IT STRENGTHENS FERC'S -- FERC'S
LEAD ROLE. REQUIRES AGENCIES TO FOLLOW CLEAR TIMELINES AND REQUIRES REVIEWS TO TAKE PLACE
CONCURRENTLY. NOT IN ENDLESS SUCCESS. AND IT STILL PRESERVES EVERY
REQUIREMENT UNDER THE CLEAN WATER ACT. THIS BILL MODERNIZES THE PER
PERMITTING PROCESS SO WE CAN BUILD THE PIPELINES THAT KEEP ENERGY AFFORDABLE. SO WE CAN BUILD THE PIPELINES
THAT POWER OUR ECONOMY. SO WE CAN BUILD THE PIPELINES THAT STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S ENERGY
SECURITY. AND DID I MENTION THAT WE CAN BUILD THE PIPELINES THAT KEEP
ENERGY AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT
THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK. ..
MR. LATTA: MR. SPEAKER, RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. WE HAVE NO OTHER SPEAKERS IF THE GENTLEMAN IS PREPARED TO CLOSE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO RESERVES. THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW JERSEY IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: THANK YOU. I'M PREPARED TO CLOSE AND AGAIN,
I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME, MR. SPEAKER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. PALLONE: AND I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL.
I HEARD WHAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID AND THIS, YOU KNOW, REHASHES THE SAME THING THAT WE
DISCUSSED WITH THE -- WITH SOME OF THE BILLS THAT WERE VOTED ON YESTERDAY. WHICH IS THIS NOTION THAT
SOMEHOW FOSSIL FUELS ARE RELIABLE AND RENEWABLES ARE NOT.
LOOK, THERE ARE LIABILITY PROBLEMS WITH EVERY FORM OF ENERGY. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO SAY
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THE ABOVE. RIGHT? IN OTHER WORDS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST SAY, AS THE REPUBLICANS
WANT, WE'RE ONLY USING FOSSIL FUELS, OIL, GAS, COAL. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH
RELIABILITY WITH THOSE. WE NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING. ALL OF THE ABOVE. AND REPUBLICANS KEEP SAYING
THEY'RE FOR ALL OF THE ABOVE, BUT THE PRESIDENT AND THEY
CONTINUALLY SAY, NO RENEWABLES. NO WIND, NO SOLAR, AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLES.
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW ONE FORM OF ENERGY IS
MORE RELIABLE THAN ANOTHER IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO CLOSE TO TALK ABOUT, MR.
SPEAKER. BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, AND MY COLLEAGUES TO UNDERSTAND HOW CONCERNED I AM
ABOUT PIPELINE SAFETY WHICH OF COURSE THEY SIMPLY IGNORE. I MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, BUT
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY DISTURBS ME ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE PUSHING TO
REMOVE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS FOR PIPELINES AT THE SAME TIME THEY'RE REFUSING TO ACT ON
VITALLY IMPORTANT PIPELINE SAFETY LEGISLATION. ALTOGETHER RIETION FOR -- AUTHORIZATION FOR FILM SARKS THE
PIPELINE -- PHMSA, THE PIPELINE SAFETY STATUTE THAT WE HAVE, THAT EXPIRED OVER TWO YEARS AGO.
ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2023. AND SINCE THEN REPUBLICANS
HAVEN'T MOVED A SINGLE BILL ON PIPELINE SAFETY TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. THEY SIMPLY HAVE NOT. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT BECAUSE
EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL WITH PIPELINE SAFETY. DOGE DEVASTATED PHMSA'S PIPELINE
SAFETY OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. ENERGY TRANSFER, A PIPELINE
COMPANY, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE IT UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THE COURTS. AND THIS SPRING, PIPELINE SAFETY
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS DROPPED TO A NEW LOW. AND IT'S JUST A DISASTER OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.
THERE'S NOBODY DOING ANYTHING ABOUT PIPELINE SAFETY. SO DEMOCRATS WONDER IF THIS WAS AN OVERSIGHT BY REPUBLICANS,
SUGAR THEY WOULD WANT -- SURELY THEY WOULD WANT TO ENSURE THAT PIPELINES ARE SAFE BEFORE MAKING IT EASIER TO BUILD MORE OF THEM.
SO MY COLLEAGUE, RANKING MEMBER CASTOR, FILED AN AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL THAT WOULD HAVE
PROHIBITED THIS BILL FROM TAKING EFFECT UNTIL CONGRESS RE-AUTHORIZED THE PIPELINE SAFETY BILL.
UNFORTUNATELY REPUBLICANS BLOCKED IT FROM COMING TO THE FLOOR. THEY ARE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT
REMOVING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS FOR GAS PIPELINES, BUT ARE STILL, I WOULD THINK,
ASHAMED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY'RE LETTING VITAL SAFETY PROVISIONS EXPIRE.
CONGRESS CAN'T GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF PIPELINES, THE FOLKS WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POLICING THEM ARE NO LONGER AT THE BEAT.
SO MY POINT IS, YOU KNOW, THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT PERMITTING REFORM, BUT THEY DON'T WORK WITH
US ON THAT. THEY KEEP SAYING THAT THEY WANT ALL KINDS OF ENERGY, BUT THEY
CUT OFF ANY POSSIBILITY OF CLEAN ENERGY WITH RENEWABLES. AND THEN THEY SAY, WELL, WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE ANY KIND OF
RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER OR INVESTIGATION OR REVIEW WHETHER WE CITE PIPELINES.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY GUT AND REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT PIPELINE SAFETY IN GENERAL. SO AGAIN, THIS BILL IS A THREAT
TO OUR SAFETY, IT'S A THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO OPPOSE IT AND WITH
THAT I YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF MY TIME, MR. SPEAKER. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. THE GENTLEMAN FROM OHIO IS
RECOGNIZED. MR. LATTA: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. YOU KNOW, NATURAL GAS IS THE MOST AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE ENERGY
SOLUTION AND ALSO, IF IT COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES, IT'S CLEAN. AND EXPANDED PIPELINE CAPACITY
IS CRITICAL TO LOWERING COSTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. AND WE HAVE HAD HEARINGS ON
PIPELINE SAFETY. THIS PAST SUMMER. ER AND FOR TOO LONG -- AND FOR TOO LONG STATES HAVE USED SECTION 401 AUTHORITY AS A
ONE-STATE VETO OF MULTISTATE PROJECTS WITH NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE.
AND AGAIN, THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE TOP 12
AND IT'S NEW ENGLAND, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, THESE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE, ASK THEIR
GOVERNOR, THE STATE LEGISLATORS, THEIR REGULATORS, WHY THE PRICES ARE SO HIGH. IT'S SIMPLE.
BECAUSE THESE STATES AGAIN HAVE USED THAT VETO. AS GLOBAL NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW
FOR DECADES TO COME, INVESTMENT IN PIPELINE PROJECTS WILL BE OF
UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO KEEPING PRICES LOW FOR OUR NATION AND TO KEEP IT SECURE. YOU KNOW, IN THE 1970'S, WHEN WE
HAD AN OIL EMBARGO ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, WHEN THE ARABS CUT US OFF, WE WERE TOLD WE HAD NO
ENERGY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED? IF YOU PUT THE RIGHT LAWS IN
PLACE, AND HAD THE REGULATIONS THAT FOLLOW AND TURN THE ENTREPRENEURS AND INNOVATORS LOOSE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE'RE
NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. WE PRODUCE MORE NATURAL GAS AND THE CLEANEST.
SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. WE HAD A HEARING EARLIER THIS
YEAR WITH OUR R.T.O.'S AND I.S.O.'S THAT REGULATE ACROSS THE ENERGY GRID OUT THERE, AND
THEY TOLD US ALL THE SAME THING. WE'VE GOT TO PRODUCE MORE ENERGY IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT LESS.
AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU BETTER NOT BE TAKING ANY GENERATION OFFLINE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE SCHEDULED TO
TAKE 115 GIGA WATTS OF POWER OFFLINE IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHEN
OUR ADVERSARY COMMUNIST CHINA ARE DOING WHAT, THEY'RE OUTPRODUCING US. WE'RE PROJECTING TO NEED 170
GIGA WATTS ON TOP OF THAT. IT'S TIME PEOPLE WAKE UP AND WE DO HAVE AN ALL-OF-THE-ABOVE
STRATEGY IN THIS COUNTRY. REPUBLICANS BROUGHT IT FORWARD IN 2008. IN 2008 WE SAID, LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING PICK THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT.
WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO GO OUT THERE AND PICK THE WINNERS AND LOSERS, THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO LOSE.
H.R. 3668 IS THE SOLUTION. I THANK THE GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP, AND I URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO
SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: ALL TIME FOR DEBATE HAS EXPIRED.

CARE AS A NAVAL OFFICER IN THE DENTAL CORPS. HIS DISTINGUISHED CAREER SPANS SEA SERVICE, ACTIVE DUTY,
RESERVE DUTY, AND RETIRING AS A LIEUTENANT COMMANDER. MR. SPEAKER, DR. MITCHELL HAS BUILT A LEGACY OF EXCELLENCE AND
DEDICATION TO OTHERS. TODAY WE HONOR HIM AS HE CELEBRATES 100 YEARS ON THIS

SURVIVE SHOCK AND VIBRATION. USING MACHINES AND EXPLOSIVES, HI-TEST HAS TESTED EVERYTHING FROM THE SMALLEST ELECTRICKIC
COMPONENTS TO ENTIRE COMPLETED SHIPS WHICH REQUIRES 40,000 POUNDS OF EXPLOSIVES.
HI-TEST ENSURES OUR SAILORS AND MARINES ARE KEPT SAFE AND SHIPS CONTINUE TO FIGHT. THEY HAVE A FACILITY THE BIGGEST
AN BEST IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, AND THEIR ALL AMERICAN CREW OF ENGINEERS AND CRAFTSMEN ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD AS WELL.
LOCATED IN THE FIFTH DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA, THIS COMPANY IS STILL OWNED BY BILL AND OPERATED BY

MS. ROSS: MR. SPEAKER, WE HAVE
REACHED THE PRECIPICE OF A FULL-BLOWN HEALTH CARE CRISIS IN NORTH CAROLINA AND THIS COUNTRY.
A.C.A. TAX CREDITS ARE ONLY WEEKS AWAY FROM EXPIRING, AND UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS, AN
ESTIMATED 157,000 NORTH CAROLINIANSS WILL LOSE THEIR COVERAGE. THIS WEEK I LED MY NORTH
CAROLINA COLLEAGUES IN DEMANDING ACTIONS FROM SPEAKER JOHNSON. WHERE IS HIS STRATEGY?
WHERE IS THE PLAN? I AM THE PROUD CO-SPONSOR OF A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION TO THIS
CRISIS, BUT SPEAKER JOHNSON REFUSES TO PUT ANY BILL ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE.
NEXT WEEK IS OUR LAST LEGISLATIVE WEEK OF THE YEAR, AND OUR LAST CHANCE TO PRESERVE
ACCESS TO LIFESAVING CARE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTH
CAROLINA, I AM PLEADING WITH MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO JOIN
DEMOCRATS IN SAVING HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
GENTLELADY YIELDS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM GEORGIA SEEK RECOGNITION?

RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. CARTER: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO HONOR THE 125TH
ANNIVERSARY OF GREAT DANE. THE COMPANY BEGAN IN 1900 AS THE
SAVANNAH BLOW PIPE COMPANY IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA. WHAT BEGAN AS A BLOW PIPE COMPANY TURNED INTO A STEEL
PRODUCTS COMPANY HELPING SHAPE THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY WITH TRAILERS, FLAT BEDS,
REFRIGERATED AND DRY FREIGHT. SINCE THEN THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPANDING PAST ITS HOSTESS CITY
ROOTS TO 11 DIFFERENT PLANTS ACROSS AMERICA EMPLOYING 4,000 PEOPLE. IN THE 1940'S, THE COMPANY
REVOLUTIONIZED FOOD DISTRIBUTION BY CIRCULATING AIR OVER ICE BLOCKS TO KEEP THINGS FRESH. IN WORLD WAR II, THE COMPANY WAS
HONORED WITH THE ARMY-NAVY EXCELLENCE AWARD FOR MAKING MILITARY GRADE TRAILERS TO SUPPORT TROOPS IN EUROPE.
NINE YEARS AGO, A STATE OFFART RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LAB OPENED FOR THE COMPANY IN
SAVANNAH. LET US CELEBRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY WHOSE LEGACY OF INNOVATION, ENDURANCE,
AND EXCELLENCE CONTINUES TO SHAPE THE WORLD OF TRANSPORTATION AND INSPIRE FUTURE GENERATIONS. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER.

HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND MY REMARKS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. LATIMER: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY BECAUSE AMERICAN UTILITY PRICES
ARE GOING UP. AND THOSE CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF THIS COUNTRY ARE DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.
MY CONSTITUENTS ARE LOOKING AT MONTHLY BILLS THAT HAVE INCREASED BY 19%, THAT'S NOT
AFFORDABILITY PLUS, PLUS, PLUS. RATHER THAN LOOKING FOR BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS TO MAKE
ENERGY MORE AFFORDABLE, THIS MAJORITY AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO FIXATE ON PUTTING YOUNG PEOPLE
BACK IN COAL MINES, AND REOPENING ALASKA TO OIL AND GAS DRILLING.
.. THERE IS NO SET CORRELATION BETWEEN MORE DRILLING AND LOWER
CONSUMER PRICES. WE MUST ACT NOW TO FIX OUR OUTDATED ELECTRIC GRID TO BRING MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
ONLINE. THIS WILL MAKE US LESS RELIANT ON NATURAL GAS PRICES THAT FLUX
WAIT -- FLUCTUATE. THIS WEEK THE MAJORITY BROUGHT BILLS BEFORE THIS HOUSE CLAIMING TO SAVE AMERICANS MONEY ON UTILITY BILLS, BUT THESE BILLS
DID NOTHING TO UPDATE OUR ELECTRIC GRID. INTERCONNECT CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS OR COMBAT THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION'S ATTACKS ON CLEAN ENERGY PERMITTING. WHILE WE WASTE OUR TIME ON THIS
LEGISLATION, I CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM CONSTITUENTS WORRIED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR NEXT
UTILITY BILL. THIS IS NOT HOW CONGRESS SHOULD FUNCTION IN THE FACE OF AN AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND THIS CRISIS IS REAL.
THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. AND I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
GENTLEMAN YIELDS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA SEEK RECOGNITION?
WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. THOMPSON: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. SATURDAY IS THE NATIONAL GUARD'S 389TH BIRTHDAY.
FOR NEARLY FOUR CENTURIES AGO THE NATIONAL GUARD WAS FOUNDED IN THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY COLONY.
SINCE THEN, THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS EXEMPLIFIED THE SPIRIT OF CITIZEN SOLDIERS, ORDINARY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ANSWER THE CALL TO
SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE. FROM THE FOOTPRINTS THAT MARK
THE SNOWS AT VALLEY FORGE TO THE SANDY BEACHES AT NORMANDY, FROM
THE SKIES ABOVE VIETNAM TO THE DESERTS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS BEEN THERE FOR AMERICA EVERY STEP OF THE
WAY. FOR 389 YEARS, THESE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE REPRESENTED AMERICA'S BEST. TODAY WE HONOR THE MEN AND WOMEN

OF OUR NATION. IMMIGRATION POLICIES REMAIN STRICTING GREEN CARDHOLDERS, BANNING ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM 19
THIRD WORLD COUNTRY, CUTTING THE WORK VISAS AND TERMINATING T.P.S. WILL HAVE DIRE ECONOMIC
CONSEQUENCES. IMMIGRANTS HAVE SUSTAINED AMERICA'S ECONOMY FOR GENERATIONS, AND IN MY HOME STATE OF FLORIDA, THEY MAKE UP
OVER 30% OF OUR WORKFORCE. AND CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN $170
BILLION IN SPENDING POWER. MANY INDUSTRIES SUCH AS CONSTRUCTION, AGRICULTURE, HOSPITALITY AND HEALTH CARE ARE
ALREADY SUFFERING SEVERE SHORTAGES. ENDING T.P.S. FOR NEARLY HALF A
MILLION HAITIANS AND VENEZUELANS WILL DEVASTATE THESE SECTORS AND THE BLATANT BAN ON 19 COUNTRIES
WILL BLOCK THE STUDENTS, NURSES, ENTREPRENEURS, SCIENTISTS AND
DRIVE AMERICAN INNOVATION TO A STAGNATION. IT BLOCKS THE NEXT EINSTEIN AND
THE NEXT CARNEGIE. WE NEED STRATEGIC POLICIES THAT ARE WORKFORCE-DRIVEN, CREATE
MERIT-BASED PATHWAYS AND EXPAND SKILLS TRAINING FOR AMERICANS TO MEET THIS MOMENT. I URGE THIS CHAMBER TO SUPPORT
IMMIGRATION SYSTEMS THAT STRENGTHEN AMERICAN FAMILIES, BUSINESSES AND OUR ECONOMY. MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK.

CLASSIFIED WAR PLANS IN AN UNAUTHORIZED SIGNAL CHAT.

OF WAR CRIMES. MR. HEGSETH MUST RESIGN FROM HIS

MAKES DILIGENT EFFORTS TO ATTEND COMMUNITY EVENTS AND ENSURE YOUNG KIDS SEE THEIR IDENTITIES
REPRESENTED IN PUBLIC SERVICE. I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK THEY DO TO KEEP OUR CITIES

MR. LAMALFA: MR. SPEAKER, AFFORDABILITY, THE BUZZWORD OF LATE. IT'S ALSO THE KEY WORD IN THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH KICKED IN WELL OVER A DECADE AGO NOW. WHERE ARE WE AT NOW? WE ARE ABOUT TO RUN INTO A CLIFF AT THE END OF THIS MONTH BECAUSE
IT ISN'T AFFORDABLE AND IT CAN'T BE PAID FOR BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS.
INSTEAD, WE HAVE TO PAY WITH EITHER BORROWED MONEY, WHAT MAKES THINGS UNAFFORDABLE TO
BEGIN WITH IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY? MANDATES. WHETHER IT'S ON HOSPITALS,
DOCTORS, WHETHER IT'S ON ANY ASPECT OF THE COST OF EQUIPMENT. ENERGY, ENERGY IS A BIG PART OF
EVERYTHING. JUST TO RUN OUR BUILDINGS, JUST TO RUN OUR OFFICES, THE CLINICS. BUT THE MANDATES THAT WE HAVE TR

ARE BUILDING OR REMODELING A HOSPITAL AND APPROVE A PLAN AND AT THE END OF THE CONSTRUCTION

MICE TITUS: -- MS. TITUS: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. CHECK OUT THIS PICTURE. THIS FABULOUS WOMAN IS A'JA
WILSON NAMED TIME'S 2025 ATHLETE OF THE YEAR. SHE BECAME THE FIRST PLAYER IN EITHER THE WNBA OR THE NBA TO
WIN CHAMPIONSHIP, CLAIM THE SCORING TITLE, AND BE NAMED FINALS M.V.P., LEAGUE M.V.P.,
AND DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR ALL IN ONE SEASON. HER IMPACT WAS PIVOTAL AS THE
LAUGHS ACES WON -- LAS VEGAS ACES WON A RECORD 16 STRAIGHT GAMES AT THE END OF THE REGULAR
SEASON, AND SWEPT THE FINALS TO CAPTURE THEIR THIRD CHAMPIONSHIP IN FOUR YEARS.
BUT BEYOND THOSE STATISTICS, A'JA CONTINUES TO ELEVATE THE SPORT.
SHE INSPIRES YOUNG GIRLS AND SHE USES HER PLATFORM TO ADVANCE EQUITY AND EMPOWERMENT ACROSS

OBJECTION, THE GENTLEWOMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MS. KAPTUR: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE
TODAY TO SOUND THE ALARM ACROSS OHIO, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS RECKLESSLY FROZEN ALL OF
OHIO'S MANUFACTURING EXTENSION PARTNERSHIP OFFICES. I REPEAT, MANUFACTURING
EXTENSION OFFICES. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE WORKED HARD TO GROW MANUFACTURING JOBS
IN AMERICA IN PLACES WE REPRESENT TO RECOVER FROM THE FOUR DECADES OF OUTSOURCING OF
U.S. PRODUCTION. I'M REALLY SHOCKED AT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THIS IMPULSIVE DECISION IS A
DIRECT BLOW TO FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESSES AND AMERICAN ENTREPRENEURS COMPETING AGAINST COMMUNIST CHINA, MEXICO, AND
EVERY OTHER LOW-WAGE HAVEN IN THE WORLD. THIS DECISION DELAYS CRITICAL
UPGRADES, INJECTS UNCERTAINTY INTO LOCAL PRODUCTION LINES, UNDERMINES NEW JOBS BEING CREATED, AND UNDERMINES EVERY
WORKER THIS NATION DEPENDS UPON. THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE SHOULD RELEASE AND RESTORE THESE JOB CREATING DOLLARS
IMMEDIATELY. CONGRESS VOTED FOR THEM. THEY SHOULD BE EXPENDED.
IF TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN SPEND $40 BILLION OFF TO ARGENTINA TO BUY FOREIGN BEEF
THAT HURTS OHIO CATTLEMEN, THEY OUGHT TO RESTORE THIS SUPPORT TO BOOST U.S. FACTORIES, COMPANIES, AND NEW JOBS HERE AT HOME.
THIS IS SIMPLY UNBELIEVABLE. BY THE WAY THE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT SECRETARY IS A WALL
STREET MAGNET. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT TAKES TO CREATE MANUFACTURING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY.
I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLELADY'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. THE GENTLEWOMAN YIELDS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE

MISS SIMONE:: I WOULD LIKE TO REMIND US HOW THIS CHILDREN USED TO DO ITS CHILDREN. BEFORE 1975 THIS COUNTRY LOCKED
UP 200,000 DISABLED CHILDREN IN INSTITUTIONS. MS. SIMON: SHE SHUT THE
SCHOOLHOUSE DOOR ON CHILDREN WHO WERE DEATH, BLIND, OR DIFFERENT IN ANY WAY WE DEEMED
INCONVENIENT. THEN PARENTS AND ADVOCATES AND ATTORNEYS THEY FOUGHT AND WON. WE PASSED LAWS ON THIS FLOOR
THAT SAID EVERY CHILD IN THIS NATION BELONGS, AND WE CREATED THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ENFORCE THOSE PROMISES IN REAL TIME AND TO INVESTIGATE
COMPLAINTS. EARLIER THIS YEAR, EMPLOYEES IN THIS OFFICE WERE FIRED. THEY WERE DISMISSED.
NOW OVER 25,000 FAMILIES ARE WAITING FOR JUSTICE ON THEIR COMPLAINTS.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION JUST REQUESTED SOME OF THESE ATTORNEYS TEMPORARILY COME BACK TO WORK THIS WEEK TO CLEAN UP
THE MESS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAUSED. BUT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY PAID THE PRICE.
THE DISMANTLING OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS NOT REFORM. THIS IS RESURRECTION OF
ABANDONMENT. CHILDREN DESERVE PROTECTION AND NOT PATHOLOGY. I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE
GENTLELADY YIELDS. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEWOMAN FROM MARYLAND SEEK RECOGNITION?
>> MR. SPEAKER, I ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE MINUTE. REVISE AND EXTEND MY REMARKS.

PRO-- PROTECTING OUR YOUTH AND PROTECTING ALMOST EVERYONE ONLINE.
THIS WEEK AUSTRALIA IMPLEMENT ADD SOCIAL MEDIA BAN FOR KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 16. I DON'T SUGGEST THE U.S. MIRROR
AUSTRALIA OR E.U. REGS EXACTLY, IT DEMONSTRATES GLOBAL PUSHBACK ON BIG TECH'S UNREGULATED IMPACT
ON OUR PRIVACY, OUR SAFETY, AND OUR WELL-BEING. PARTICULARLY FOR OUR CHILDREN. FOR TOO LONG THESE COMPANIES
HAVE OPERATED POWERFUL SYSTEMS WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT AND NO
GUARDRAILS, WITH NAME TO PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY B I CAME TO
AMONG I WORKED AS A ATTORNEY, A NONPROFIT ADVOCATE ADVOCATING ON
THESE ISSUES. IT WAS THIS WORK TO JOIN REP KENNEDY OF UTAH TO INTRODUCE THE
ALGORITHM ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. PLATFORMS MUST BEGIN TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DESIGNING, TESTING, AN OPERATING PLATFORMS

UNDER THE SPEAKER'S ANNOUNCED POLICY OF JANUARY 3, 2025, THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, MR. GREEN,
IS RECOGNIZED FOR 60 MINUTES AS THE DESIGNEE OF THE MINORITY LEADER. MR. GREEN: THANK YOU, MR.
SPEAKER. MR. SPEAKER, AND STILL I RISE.
A PROUD, LIBERATED DEMOCRAT.
UNBOUGHT, UNBOSSED, AND UNAFRAID. I RISE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE. I AM KNOWN TO WEAR THIS TIE THAT
HAS WHAT I CONSIDER A MEANING
THAT EXPRESSES MUCH OF WHAT THE PLEDGE IS ALL ABOUT. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID TO ME THAT THE TIE IS OLD.
THAT IT APPEARS TO BE SOILED AND STAINED. BUT IT'S MY FAVORITE TIE.
IT'S A TIE THAT I WILL NEVER SURRENDER. IT'S A TIE THAT MEANS SOMETHING
TO ME BECAUSE IT STANDS FOR SOMETHING. IT STANDS FOR THE PLEDGE OF
ALLEGIANCE. MORE APPROPRIATELY IT STANDS FOR SOME SPECIFIC WORDS WITHIN THAT
PLEDGE. THOSE WORDS ARE LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
I DO PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
AND I RISE TODAY TO THANK THE COURAGEOUS PERSONS WHO ON JUST
YESTERDAY TOOK A STAND FOR LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
I RISE TO THANK THE 140 PERSONS
WHO ON YESTERDAY VOTED TO SUPPORT H.RES. 939, HOUSE
RESOLUTION 939. THIS RESOLUTION, HOUSE 939,
IMPEACHING DONALD JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH CRIMES AND
MISDEMEANORS. I RISE TO THANK THE 140 PERSONS WHO SUPPORTED THIS RESOLUTION.
I RISE TO THANK THE 47 PERSONS WHO DID NOT OPPOSE WHAT WE WERE
DOING. BUT CHOSE TO SIMPLY SAY, I WILL VOTE PRESENT. THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT VOTE AS
WELL. I RISE TO THANK THEM. ALL OF THESE PERSONS HAD THE
COURAGE TO SAY, TO DONALD JOHN TRUMP, THINGS ARE CHANGING IN
THIS COUNTRY. YOU ARE LIKELY TO FACE A VOTE OF
218 MORE PERSONS WHO WOULD VOTE TO HAVE YOU IMPEACHED. I RISE TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR
COURAGE. BUT I ALSO RISE WITH MY CANE IN
HAND TO THANK TWO PEOPLE. I WANT TO THANK JOHN BONIFAST.
JOHN, CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR JOHN BONIFAST. THERE ARE MANY CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLARS IN THIS COUNTRY, LET ME HARKEN BACK JUST A MOMENT TO
MAKE THIS POINT CLEAR. THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO
UNDERSTOOD WHAT INVIDIOUS DISCRIMINATION KNOWN AS
SEGREGATION, BUT IN FACT RACISM, MANY WHO KNEW WHAT IT WAS, THEY UNDERSTOOD T THEY COULD
ARTICULATE IT WELL. THEY WERE GREAT OR RATERS --
ORATORS, BUT THEY HAD SOMETHING THAT SET THEM APART FROM DR. KING. IT WAS A LACK OF COURAGE.
DR. KING WAS SET APART FROM THE INTELLECTUALS AND GREAT ORATORS OF HIS TIME BECAUSE HE HAD
COURAGE. IT WAS HIS COURAGE THAT AWILL YOUD HIM -- ALLOWED HIM TO GO TO
BIRMINGHAM. AND FROM THE BIRMINGHAM JAIL TO WRITE A LETTER THAT EXPLAINED WHY THE MOVEMENT EXISTED AND WHY
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT. IT WAS COURAGE. JOHN BO NIFAST, CONSTITUTIONAL
SCHOLAR PAR EXCELLENCE. HE HAS SOMETHING THAT MANY OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS JUST DON'T HAVE.
THEY ARE BRILLIANT. THEY COULD ELUCIDATE AND EXPLAIN TO YOU THE FEDERALIST PAPERS IN
GREAT DETAIL. THEY COULD TELL YOU WHY YOU SHOULDN'T, AND WHY YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHING. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE
OF JOHN BONIFAST. THE COURAGE TO SPEAK NOT ONLY TRUTH TO POWER, YOU CAN SPEAK
TRUTH TO POWER BY SIMPLY SAYING
POWER. THERE'S A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT.
HE WILL SPEAK TRUTH ABOUT POWER, WHICH MEANS YOU GO TO POWER AND SAY POWER, THERE IS A PROBLEM.
AND YOU ARE IT. YOU ARE IT.
JOHN HAS THAT KIND OF POWER. JOHN HAS THAT KIND OF COURAGE.
JOHN, I THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO HELP ME MOVE
IMPEACHMENT TO THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FOR A VOTE. I WANT HISTORY TO KNOW WHO YOU
WERE. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT YOU LEFT BIG TRACKS, BIG TRACKS IN
THE SANDS OF TIME. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT YOU CAME FROM ONE DIRECTION AND THAT
YOU PROCEEDED TO ANOTHER, A RIGHTEOUS DIRECTION. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO
JESSICA DENSON IS. WHO IS THE MOTHER, FOUNDER OF
THE REMOVABLE COALITION, WHO BELIEVES THAT IMPEACHMENT, CONVICTION, AND REMOVAL THAT
THAT'S A PART OF THE PROCESS, BUT IT IS ALSO THE SOLUTION.
.. JESSICA IS A COURAGEOUS WOMAN, A
COURAGEOUS WOMAN WHO HAS A VOICE THAT IS SOMETIMES AMAZING TO ME
IN TERMS OF HOW SHE SO CLEARLY ARTICULATES THE ISSUES OF OUR
TIME. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO BE THERE WHEN
WE WERE IN FRONT OF THE LINCOLN MONUMENT, TO BE THERE, TO BE THE
KEY, THE CORNERSTONE OF THE MOVEMENT THAT CAUSED US TO GET TO THE LINCOLN MONUMENT.
THAT SHE WAS THERE TO SUPPORT BUT ALSO TO PUSH FOR IMPEACHMENT
, CONVICTION, AND REMOVAL. SHE IS TRULY ONE OF THE GREAT
PATRIOTS OF OUR TIME. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE NOW WHO ARE ASSOCIATING THEMSELVES WITH THIS
COURAGE OF BONIFAZ, WITH THIS COURAGE OF DENSON, WITH THIS
COURAGE OF THE 140 WHO YESTERDAY VOTED TO SUPPORT H.RES. 939, OF
THE 47 WHO ALSO TOOK A POSITION
YESTERDAY. AND COURAGE, I MUST MENTION COURAGE. THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN SIMPLY
BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM TO. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO WHAT WE DID
YESTERDAY. IT IS NOT. CROSSCURRENTS, WINDS.
ALSO OF ENERGY PUSHING BACK. DON'T DO IT.
LET ME PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND SAY THIS. THOSE WHO ARE ANTITHETICAL TO MY
VIEWS, THEY LIKE TO SAY THAT AL GREEN HAS GONE ROGUE.
IT'S IN THE PAPERS TODAY. AL GREEN IS COMING BEFORE CONGRESS AND HAS HIS CANE AND
HE'S JUST WAVING HIS CANE. THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY. THEY WOULD HAVE ME BECOME A
PERSON WHO IS JUST ANOTHER PERSON FROM SOME DARK PLACE WHO
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, SO THEY TALK ABOUT ME WAVING MY CANE. YES, I'M WAVING MY CANE AND I'M
POINTING IT STRAIGHT TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE ANTITHETICAL TO RIGHTEOUSNESS, ANTITHETICAL TO
WHAT WE DID YESTERDAY IN BRINGING THESE ARTICLES TO A VOTE. I'M POINTING MY CANE AT YOU.
I'M POINTING IT TO THOSE WHO ARE PART OF THE NEWS MEDIA WHO WILL BRING ME UP AND SAY THINGS ABOUT ME BUT WON'T ALLOW ME TO RESPOND
TO THEM. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
BUT, AS I WAS SAYING, I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS COURAGE AND THE PUSHBACK AND THE
ANTITHETICAL FORCES. I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT IT. AND I WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT I
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. IT WAS COMPARABLE TO WHAT HAPPENED AT THE EDMUND PETTUS
BRIDGE. YESTERDAY WAS A SEMINAL MOMENT IN TIME. IT WAS COMPARABLE TO WHAT
HAPPENED. IT WAS COMPARABLE TO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN JOHN LEWIS EXPLAINED IT TO ME, WHAT MEAN
PEOPLE NEVER DISCUSS IS THE FACT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THAT YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO
THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE, THAT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. IF YOU GO TO THE EDMUND PETTUS
BRIDGE, YOU COULD BE HURT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONSTABULARY WOULD DO. THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WARNED
THEM, ADMONISHED THEM, PLEADED WITH SOME OF THEM SAYING, THOSE PEOPLE WILL HURT YOU.
THESE PEOPLE ARE INSPIRED BY HATE. THERE'S SOME EVIL PEOPLE AMONG
THEM. IT WAS COURAGE, HOWEVER, THAT SAID GO ON TO THE EDMUND PETTUS
BRIDGE. GO ON TO THE EDMUND PETTUS BRIDGE. NOT ONLY DID THEY GO, BUT WHEN
THEY REACHED THAT CREST, THEY COULD SEE A POINT WHERE THE
CONSTABULARY WAS THERE, SOME ON HORSEBACK. AND THEY KNEW AT THAT POINT THAT
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ADMONISHED THEM WERE RIGHT.
BUT THEY MARCHED ON. THEY DID NOT ALLOW FEAR TO
PREVENT THEM FROM DOING A RIGHTEOUS THING EVEN WHEN THEY
KNEW THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE HARMFUL. I KEEP SAYING IT AND I'LL SAY IT UNTIL I MAKE MY TRANSITION.
JOHN LEWIS TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DIE ON THAT BRIDGE. BUT HE MARCHED ON.
YESTERDAY, IN SPITE OF A LOT OF ADMONITIONS, PEOPLE MARCHED ON.
PEOPLE MARCHED ON AND THEY TOOK A COURAGEOUS VOTE, A VOTE THAT
IS GOING TO BE MARKED AS A SEMINAL MOMENT IN TIME, A VOTE THAT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE
REST OF TIME BECAUSE IT SENT A MESSAGE TO A RECKLESS, RUTHLESS,
LAWLESS PRESIDENT, INDICATING THAT YOUR TIME IN OFFICE AS A
RECKLESS, RUTHLESS, LAWLESS PRESIDENT, THAT TIME, YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOU HARMED
PHYSICALLY. THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT
BELIEVE YOU SHOULD SERVE OUT THIS TERM OF OFFICE GIVEN YOUR BEHAVIOR IN OFFICE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE YOU OUGHT TO BE IMPEACHED. YOU OUGHT TO BE CONVICTED.
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE REMOVED. I AM ONE OF THE PEOPLE. I AM ONE OF THE PEOPLE.
WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE REMOVAL MOVEMENT, BELIEVE THAT YOU, SIR,
SHOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A
RIGHTEOUS GOVERNMENT WILL DO WHEN A PERSON WHO WILL SUBVERT
THE CONSTITUTION HAS SLITHERED HIS WAY INTO OFFICE. YOU, SIR, SHOULD BE THE EXAMPLE.
YOU, SIR, BY YOUR BEHAVIOR, BY YOUR ACTIONS, BIER WORDS, BY
YOUR DEEDS. YOU, SIR, SHOULD NOT HOLD THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND YOU SHOULD BE REMOVED.
I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD WANT TO WAIT. WELL, HE'LL LEAVE OFFICE IN A COUPLE YEARS. AND AFTER HE LEAVES OFFICE IN A
COUPLE YEARS, WE'LL GET BACK TO OUR NORMAL LIVES. NOT THE CASE.
THIS MAN IS HAVING A LONG-TERM IMPACT ON AMERICAN SOCIETY.
NOT THE CASE. THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WANT TO MIMIC HIM. THERE ARE MANY TRUMPS, NOT MANY
IN TERMS OF NUMBERS, THOUGH I COULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE LARGE NUMBERS, BUT THERE ARE MANY IN
TERMS OF BEING SMALLER NOW WHO WOULD LIKE TO ENLARGE THEIR
PERSONA, ENLARGE THEIR IMAGE, AND ENLARGE THEIR REACH AND
ENLARGE THEIR POWER. MANY TRUMPS WHO WANT TO BE ANOTHER DONALD TRUMP. THEY'RE OUT THERE.
AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, WHEN YOU BEHAVE
AS HE HAS BEHAVED, JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.
YESTERDAY THE SWORD OF JUSTICE SWUNG ACROSS THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES AND LEFT ITS INDELIBLE MARK.
PEOPLE KNOW NOW THAT WE MEAN BUSINESS. YES, WE MEAN BUSINESS.
SO TO THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE JOINED THE IMPEACH, CONVICT, AND REMOVAL COALITION,
I THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE. I ESPECIALLY THANK THE PERSONS WHO WERE ON ON THE MALL AT THE
LINCOLN MEMORIAL. NOW I'D LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE
QUESTION, IF I HAVEN'T ALREADY, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, AL
GREEN? THAT REALLY IS NOT THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION REALLY IS, WHY WOULDN'T I DO IT?
WHY WOULDN'T I DO IT WHEN I HAVE IN MY HAND LANGUAGE THAT
MOTIVATES ME TO DO IT? LET ME READ WHAT I BEAR IN MY
HAND. IT SAYS HERE, DICK CHENEY'S
STATEMENT FOR FURTHER EDIFICATION. THAT WOULD BE VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY. THIS IS HIS STATEMENT ON DONALD
TRUMP'S STATEMENT. TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT N.P.R.
PUBLISHED, SEPTEMBER 6, 2024. VICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY. BY THE WAY, HE WAS A REPUBLICAN.
I NEED NOT SAY IT. BUT I THINK THAT IT ADDS TO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY. I AM A DEMOCRAT.
I THINK WE WERE IN DIFFERENT PLACES POLITICALLY.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE COUNTRY, WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE. WE WERE IN THE SAME PLACE THEN
AND WE'RE IN THE SAME PLACE NOW. AND HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.
IN OUR NATION'S 248-YEAR HISTORY, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A GREATER THREAT TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY --
CORRECTION, A GREATER THREAT TO
OUR REPUBLIC THAN DONALD TRUMP. LET ME REPEAT IT, IN OUR NATION'S 248-YEAR HISTORY,
THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A GREATER THREAT TO OUR REPUBLIC THAN DONALD TRUMP.
BUT THEN HE GOES ON TO INSPIRE.
BECAUSE HE SAYS, AS CITIZENS, WE
EACH HAVE A DUTY -- I WOULD ADD THE WORD "RESPONSIBILITY." WE EACH HAVE A DUTY TO PUT OUR
COUNTRY ABOVE PARTISANSHIP, PUT OUR COUNTRY ABOVE PARTISANSHIP
TO DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION. PUT OUR COUNTRY ABOVE
PARTISANSHIP AND DEFEND OUR CONSTITUTION. THOSE WORDS INSPIRE ME.
I BELIEVE THAT HE IS RIGHT. WE HAVE TO PUT COUNTRY ABOVE
PARTISANSHIP. WE'VE GOT TO DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION. THAT MEANS DEFEND LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL. NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IT IS SYMBOLIC OF WHAT THE
CONSTITUTION REPRESENTS. IT MEANS DEFEND YOUR FIFTH
AMENDMENT RIGHTS, THE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. THE 14TH AMENDMENT, ALSO.
DEFEND YOUR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH. DEFEND YOUR RIGHT TO SAY THAT
MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW ILLEGAL ORDERS. IN FACT, MUST NOT FOLLOW ILLEGAL
ORDERS. THAT'S WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S THE CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S WHAT COMES OUT OF THE CONSTITUTION, ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE EXPLICATED WITH WHICH
KIND OF SPECIFICITY WITHIN THE CONSTITUTION. THAT'S IT. YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO SAY.
DON'T FOLLOW ILLEGAL ORDERS. THAT'S A MANDATE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S
OPTIONAL. YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO SAY IT. AND YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO SAY IT
WITHOUT HAVING SOMEONE INDICATE THAT YOU SOMEHOW HAVE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT YOU SOMEHOW OUGHT TO BE HANGED.
NOW, I'LL SAY MORE ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. I HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THAT. BUT BEFORE I SAY IT, I WANT TO
SAY THIS. IF YOU, ANY ONE OF YOU, IF I, IF
I THREATEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA -- I'VE
GOT A PUNISHMENT HERE IN MY HAND. IF YOU'RE CONVICTED UNDER
18 U.S.C. SECTION 871 OF THREATENING THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES, YOU CAN SUFFER CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING UP TO FIVE YEARS IN A FEDERAL PRISON,
FINES OF $250,000, A PERMANENT
FELONY ON YOUR RECORD, POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON FUTURE EMPLOYMENT, FIREARM OWNERSHIP,
AND OTHER RIGHTS. SO NOW, IF I OR ANY ONE OF YOU
SHOULD INDICATE IN SOME WAY THAT THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO SOMEHOW
RECEIVE A DEATH SENTENCE OR IF I OR ONE OF YOU SHOULD INDICATE
THAT THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO BE HANGED, I GUARANTEE YOU THIS
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE YOU ARRESTED. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT YOU WOULD
BE INCARCERATED. I GUARANTEE YOU, BECAUSE YOU CAN INDICT A HAM SANDWICH, THEY SAY,
YOU WOULD BE INDICTED AND I GUARANTEE YOU, YOU WOULD GO TO
TRIAL. .. IF YOU DO SOMETHING THAT'S
CONSIDERED THREATENING, IF YOU SAY -- HERE'S A GOOD WORD. IF YOU SAY THE PRESIDENT OUGHT
TO RECEIVE DEATH, BE PUNISHABLE BY DEATH, OR IF YOU SAY THAT HE
OUGHT TO BE HANGED AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HERE WHEN HE POSTED A THIRD PARTY'S POST,
INDICATING HANG THEM. WASHINGTON WOULD. INDICATING HERE THAT THEIR
BEHAVIOR WAS SEE DISHES BEHAVIOR
PUNISHABLE BY DEATH. I'M TALKING ABOUT PERSONS WHO DID THE RIGHT THING, LAWFUL THING, RIGHT THING OF SAYING TO
PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY, DON'T FOLLOW ILLEGAL ORDERS.
AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES, NOT THE PRESIDENT, BUT THEMSELVES
BEING SUSPECT. THE PRESIDENT WHO HAS THREATENED
EXECUTION, PEOPLE DON'T WANT HIM
IMPEACHED. SOME. THERE ARE SOME WHO DO, BUT THEY
HAVE VARIOUS REASONS FOR WHY THEY CAN'T TAKE THE STAND.
THEY CAN'T SAY IT. WELL, I CAN. SO FOR ALL OF YOU WHO WANT TO SAY IT AND CAN'T SAY IT, I'M
SAYING IT FOR YOU. I'M SAYING, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IMPEACHED. I'M SAYING THAT IF EVER THERE WAS A PRESIDENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
WHO SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, IT IS DONALD JOHN TRUMP. FOR WHAT HE SAID HE SHOULD BE
IMPEACHED FOR. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY, WELL, YOU DO KNOW THAT HE WENT OVER TO FOX NEWS, THAT HE
SLITHERED HIS WAY OVER THERE, AND AFTER BEING THERE HE INDICATED THAT HE DIDN'T INTEND
FOR ANYBODY TO BE KILLED. MAYBE NOT IN THOSE EXACT WORDS.
BUT HE DIDN'T INTEND. HE DIDN'T INTEND FOR THAT TO BE THE CASE. DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT IF I
SAID THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO BE HANGED, THAT I COULD GO OVER TO
FOX -- FOX WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO SAY T. BUT SOME NEWS SOURCE -- SAY IT, BUT SOME NEWS SOURCE,
FORGIVE ME. I MADE A MISTAKE. IT WAS A SLIP OF MY TONGUE. NO. THIS PRESIDENT WOULD NOT ALLOW
IT. HE WOULD CONSIDER THIS A THREAT. I WOULD BE FACING A FINE.
I WOULD BE FACING GOING TO PRISON. BUT THE PRESIDENT IS WITH
IMPUNITY SAVING WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, WITH IMPUNITY MAKING
THREATS AGAINST JUDGES, MAKING THREATS AGAINST MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS, AND FOR THOSE WHO SAY, WELL, THAT'S JUST CONGRESS AND
THEY ARE JUST JUDGES, LET ME TELL YOU HOW IT IMPACTS YOUR LIFE. IF YOU GO BEFORE ONE OF THE
JUDGES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS THREATENED, AND YOU BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT'S THREATS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, WILL YOU QUESTION
THE JUDGMENT OF THE JUDGE? HE PUT THE JUDICIARY IN QUESTION. THE JUDGMENT. WHEN HE COULD INTIMIDATE JUDGES
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU THINK JUDGES ARE ACTING BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS THAT HE'S TAKEN AGAINST THE JUDGE.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN YOU ARE AS A PERSON. IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US AS PEOPLE.
THREATENING THE JUDICIARY. THREATENING THE INDEPENDENCE OF
THE JUDICIARY. NOT RESPECTING THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.
IT IMPACTS YOU, ME, WE ALL CAN BE JUDGED AT SOME POINT. WE WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THE
JUDGE WILL BE OBJECTIVE. THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO BE SUBJECTED. THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO OR SHE'S NOT GOING TO SUBJECT HER MOST
PRECIOUS JUDICIOUS THOUGHTS TO THE WHIMS OF A PRESIDENT WHO IS
RECKLESS, RUTHLESS, AND LAWLESS. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE. OK. WELL, MAYBE THAT TAKES CARE OF
THE JUDGES, CONGRESSMAN GREEN, BUT WHAT ABOUT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS? HE'S JUST THREATENING THEM.
REMEMBER, WE HAD A MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO WAS WOUNDED, THAT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE
HER. THERE WERE INNOCENT BYSTANDERS THERE WITH HER WHO WERE HARMED.
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US. IT'S ABOUT WHEN WE ARE OUT IN THE PUBLIC.
IT'S ABOUT SOME PERSON TAKING TO HEART WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHEN HE SAID, DEATH.
WHEN HE SAID HANG THEM. IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US.
SO I HAVE NO REGRETS FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE. ZERO.
AND WOULD CHALLENGE ANYONE TO COME AND STAND OVER HERE OR HERE
AND STAND WITH ME. I CHALLENGE YOU TO COME AND STAND AND POINT OUT WHY I
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT I HAVE DONE. OR WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE, MEANING THOSE WHO
ARE PART OF THE REMOVAL COALITION. COME, I CHALLENGE YOU. LET'S TALK BEFORE THE WORLD.
ANY ONE -- ANY ONE OF YOU, I'M PROUD OF WHAT I HAVE DONE. I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IN DOING THIS, WE ARE PUTTING THE COUNTRY
ABOVE SOME PEOPLE. WE ARE. BECAUSE IT'S THE COUNTRY THAT
CONTAINS ALL OF THE PEOPLE. ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN SOME ONE OR TWO,
10 PEOPLE MAYBE, MAYBE 23. MORE IMPORTANT THAN 23 PEOPLE.
IT'S THE COUNTRY WE ARE TRYING TO SAVE. WELL, HOW DO YOU SAVE THE
COUNTRY WITHOUT HAVING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AL?
BY SHOWING THE COUNTRY THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THIS COUNTRY IS GOING TO CAUSE US TO DISSOLVE
INTO SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING. WE ARE ALREADY AT THE POINT OF
HAVING A PERSON WHO IS LESS -- MAYBE LESS THAN A DICTATOR, BUT
AN AUTHORITARIAN. WE ARE GETTING CLOSE, WHEN THE
PRESIDENT CONTROLS ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT HAS THE MAJORITY, THE REPUBLICANS, WHEN A
PRESIDENT, THAT'S IN THE HOUSE, CONTROLS ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE CALLED REPUBLICANS IN THE
SENATE, WHEN A PRESIDENT HAS STACKED THE SUPREME COURT OF THE
UNITED STATES, YES, HE STACKED THE DECK, WHEN HE STACKED THE SUPREME COURT AND HE'S GOT
RULINGS THAT PEOPLE NEVER THOUGHT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD RENDER, ALL THAT'S LEFT IS
IMPEACHMENT. THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT. AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD SAY, LET'S JUST WAIT.
WHY DON'T WE WAIT. THEY TOLD DR. KING TO WAIT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DR. KING SAID IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTION THAT WE MUST WAIT, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT HE SAID WAS, THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO WHAT
IS RIGHT. SO NOW, I SAY TO YOU, WHAT WE DID YESTERDAY WAS NOT ONLY
RIGHT, IT WAS RIGHTEOUS. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THOSE ARTICLES IS TRUE.
IT'S RIGHTEOUS. AND WE DON'T HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS COMING OUT AND SAYING, WELL, IT REALLY DOESN'T COMPLY
WITH FEDERALIST NUMBER WHATEVER. THAT'S NOT THE ARGUMENT. THE ARGUMENT IS, THIS IS NOT THE
TIME. I DIFFER. THE TIME AS DR. KING PUT IT IS ALWAYS RIGHT TO DO WHAT IS
RIGHT. NOW, DR. KING DIDN'T EXPECT EVERYBODY TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT
WHEN HE WAS DOING T AND I DON'T EXPECT EVERYBODY WHO BELIEVES THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING IS RIGHT BUT WON'T DO IT THEMSELVES TO DO
WHAT IS RIGHT WITH US. I UNDERSTAND. BUT WHAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO
AND I BEG YOU NOT DO IS ASSAULT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING UP FOR YOU.
IN CLEVER LANGUAGE. DON'T DO THAT. DON'T ASSAULT US.
WE MAY FIGHT BACK. BUT DON'T DO THAT.
I HAVE BIGGER THINGS TO DO. I'M NOT GOING TO SAY UGLY
THINGS. BUT MY POINT IS. THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY ONE OF
US IN THIS CONGRESS. IT IS BIGGER THAN THE CONGRESS, HOUSE AND SENATE TOGETHER.
AND THE JUDICIARY. THIS IS ABOUT THE COUNTRY. WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY WILL HE
LEAVE WHEN HE LEAVES OFFICE? THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH.
AND MY FRIENDS ACROSS THE AISLE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF HOW HE IS
ENREACHING UPON -- ENCROACHING UPON THE SEPARATION OF POWERS,
THE JUDICIARY. HOW HE IS THREATENING THE
SUPREME COURT AND THREATENING JUDGES WITH ABUSIVE LANGUAGE.
WHEN YOU THREATEN ONE JUDGE, YOU ARE THREATENING THEM ALL. LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.
HE'S DOING IT. NOW I'M GOING TO SHARE THIS WITH
YOU. I KNOW WHO THIS PRESIDENT IS.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I'M GOING TO A
DIFFERENT TOPIC IN SHARING WITH YOU WHO HE IS. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHO HE IS.
BECAUSE IN TELLING YOU WHO HE IS, I WILL BE GOING TO A DIFFERENT TOPIC.
I MADE MY POINT ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU WHO HE
IS. BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE. I KNOW HIM. THIS IS A DIFFERENT TOPIC NOW.
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE TO BE SAID ABOUT THIS PRESIDENT THAN WHAT WAS SAID IN THE ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT. AND I WANT TO SAY THAT MORE THAT HAS TO BE SAID AT THIS TIME. ABOUT WHO HE IS.
THAT WASN'T IN THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT. AND TO SAY THAT I'M GOING TO
MOVE TO ANOTHER PODIUM, MOVE TO
ANOTHER PODIUM. GIVE ME JUST A MOMENT AS I MOVE TO ANOTHER PODIUM.
AND STILL I RISE, MR. SPEAKER. AND I RISE NOW TO EXPLAIN TO THE
WORLD WHO DONALD JOHN TRUMP IS.
I HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE.
I HAVE SEEN HIS COUSINS. I HAVE SEEN HIS RELATIVES. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHO HE IS.
I SAW HIM ON JUNE 11 OF 1963
WHEN HE STOOD IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE DOOR. HE WAS GEORGE WALL LIST --
WALLIS. I SAW HIM WHEN HE FOUGHT DESEGREGATION IN THIS COUNTRY.
I SAW HIM. HE METAMORPHOSES, HE CHANGES,
HE'S A SHIP.
SHIP SHAPER, CHANGES HIS MAKEUP, HIS APPEARANCE. NOW THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE
THAT LITERALLY AND SAY GOSH, HE THINKS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS
GEORGE WALLIS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M SAYING GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS A
FORERUNNER OF DONALD TRUMP. SO I SAW HIM. I KNOW WHO HE IS.
HE WASN'T WASHINGTON, BUT HE'S IN A SENSE HIS COUSIN. HE WAS GEORGE WASHINGTON'S
COUSIN. HE'S A RELATIVE. NOT BECAUSE OF ETHNICITY, NOT
BECAUSE OF RACE, BUT BECAUSE OF BEHAVIOR RELATIVE IN TERMS OF
THEIR RELATED, IN TERMS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR. I KNOW HE S I SAW HIM IN 1964
WHEN HE WAS LESTER MADDOX AND HAD AN AX HANDLE AND HE USED HIS
AX HANDLE TO THREATEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. I SAW HIM WITH THAT AX HANDLE
WHEN HE WOULDN'T ALLOW BLACK PEOPLE INTO HIS RESTAURANT. I KNOW WHO HE IS.
I SAW HIS COUSIN, MILTON FRIEDMAN, NOBEL LAUREATE, WENT
AFTER THE BROWN VERSUS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION DECISION WAS RENDERED, HE WENT PUBLIC AND
SAID, LET'S USE VOUCHERS TO MAINTAIN SEGREGATION. THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING,
LET'S USE VOUCHERS TO MAINTAIN RACISM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
SEGREGATION WAS. IT WAS RACISM. I KNOW WHO HE IS.
BECAUSE I READ ABOUT HIM AND
WHAT HE DID ON MAY 18 OF 1869 IN
PLESSY VS. FERGUSON, THE CASE THAT ALLOWED INVIDIOUS DISCRIMINATION TO BLOOM AND
BLOSSOM AND PERMEATE SOCIETY, I KNOW WHO HE IS. .. SOME OF YOU DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW HIS COUSINS, HIS RELATIVES. I KNOW WHO I KNOW HIS COUSINS.
I KNOW HIS RELATIVES. I READ WHAT HIS RELATIVES DID ON MARCH 6, 1857 IN DRED SCOTT
VERSUS -- DRED SCOTT VS.
STANFORD WHEN THEY CONCLUDED THE CHIEF JUSTICE, A BLACK PERSON HAD NO RIGHTS A BLACK PERSON HAD
TO RESPECT. I KNOW WHO HE IS. I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
THERE BEFORE HIM TO PAVE THE WAY FOR HIM TO DO WHAT HE'S DOING NOW.
I KNOW HIM. AND BECAUSE I KNOW HIM, I HAVE TO FIGHT HIM. I KNOW WHAT HE DID IN MY
LIFETIME. HE DIDN'T HAVE A PERSONAL HAND IN WHAT HAPPENED. BUT WHEN I SAY "HE DID" I'M
SAYING THE PEOPLE THAT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO WHAT HE'S DOING NOW. LET'S SAY I KNOW WHAT THEY DID
SO THAT FOX NEWS AND SOME OF THE MANY OTHERS WHO ARE ANTITHETICAL TO HEARING THE TRUTH, MAYBE THEY
WON'T OBLITERATE THE TRUTH TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DOING. BUT HERE'S WHAT I KNOW.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN MY LIFETIME, WHEN I HAD TO GO TO THE BACKDOOR TO GET MY FOOD.
I REMEMBER WHEN I HAD TO DRINK FROM A FILTHY COLORED WATER FOUNTAIN WHEN THERE WAS A
PRISTINE WHITEWATER FOUNTAIN RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I KNOW. I LIVED IT.
I REMEMBER HOW I HAD TO SIT IN THE BACK OF THE BUS.
AND IF THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SEAT FOR ANGLOS, WE CALL THEM WHITE PEOPLE, I DON'T LIKE THE TERM.
BUT WHEN THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SEATS FOR ANGLOS, I HAD TO MOVE. I KNOW. I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
I SEE IT. WELL, YOU SAY THAT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.
NO. BUT WE'RE HEADED IN THAT
DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION. I DON'T WANT TO RETURN TO THAT PAST WHERE I WAS A SUSPECT JUST
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN. I WAS A SUSPECT.
WE ARE NOW AT A POINT IN THIS COUNTRY TO TIE THIS TOGETHER
WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSPECT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY LOOK JUST AS I WAS A SUSPECT
BECAUSE OF THE WAY I LOOKED. IF YOU ARE LATINO IN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA, GIVEN THE BEHAVIOR OF THE KING'S MEN, THAT WOULD BE PRESIDENT TRUMP, GIVEN
THE BEHAVIOR OF THE KING'S MEN, YOU ARE A SUSPECT.
YOU ARE SUSPECT. AND THE KING'S MEN CAN SHOW UP
WITH A MASK, FACES COVERED, COLLECT YOU -- THAT'S A VERY
KIND WAY OF SAYING IT. HERD YOU IN SOME VEHICLE AND THEN STORM AWAY TO SOME DISTANT
PLACE, LOCK YOU UP, RELATIVES DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
NO DUE PROCESS. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
I'VE SUFFERED WHAT YOU WOULD RETURN IF YOU COULD.
I KNOW. YES, I SEE HOW YOU HAVE DECIDED
THAT YOU AND YOU ALONE DETERMINE WHAT THE LAW IS IN THIS COUNTRY.
YOU AND YOU ALONE WILL DECIDE WHETHER A PERSON SHOULD BE
LOCKED UP OR RELEASED, UNLIKE WHAT THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S AN
ATTEMPT TO ROLL BACK THE CLOCK. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE BECOMING SUSPECT IN THIS COUNTRY.
NOW, YOU CAN BE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU CAN BE
ASIAN, YOU CAN BE LATINO, BUT WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS YOU BEING
SUSPECT. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OF GOODWILL OF ALL COLORS WHO ARE GOING TO
FIGHT THIS. I PRAY THAT WE WILL SUCCEED.
PEOPLE OF GOODWILL WHO ARE WHITE WHO ARE STANDING WITH US. BUT IT'S EASY TO SEE IF YOU CARE
TO LOOK AT HOW THE PRESIDENT HAS NOW SAID YES, I SAID THERE WERE
COUNTRIES AND NOW THERE'S GENOCIDE BUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THE 19 COUNTRIES, NOW THERE'S
18, THAT ARE PREDOMINATED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR, WE'RE PUTTING A HOLD ON YOU.
LOOK, THERE IS NO ONE SO BLIND AS HE WHO WON'T SEE, NOT HE WHO CAN'T, BUT HE WHO CHOOSES NOT TO
SEE. I KNOW WHO HE IS. I KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE TO LAY THE
FOUNDATION. NOT HIM PERSONALLY BUT THE MANY WHO CAME BEFORE HIM AND WHO KNOW
HOW TO USE HATE AS A WEAPON.
TO CHANGE SOCIETY. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING. HE'S USING HATE. HE'S USING BENEFICIAL BIG TRI --
BIGOTRY. HOW DOES BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY WORK, AL GREEN? HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. YOU GO TO SOMEONE WHO IS A
PRINCIPALLED PERSON, SOMEONE FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL, AND YOU DO THEM A FAVOR. AND IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT FAVOR,
YOU ONLY REQUIRE ONE THING, LOYALTY. JUST GIVE ME YOUR LOYALTY.
GIVE ME YOUR LOYALTY IN THE FUTURE. THE THING THAT HE HAS DONE CAN
SOMETIMES BE A BENEFIT TO THE PERSON. MOST OF THE TIME IT IS. BUT IT CAN ALSO BE DETRIMENTAL
TO SOME OTHER PEOPLE.
HE USES BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY. BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY.
IT IS BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY THAT HE
HAS USED AGAINST THE PALESTINIANS. IT IS. IT IS.
BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY TO SAY THAT THEY CAN BE OBLITERATED, TO SAY
THAT THE PALESTINIANS DON'T
DESERVE A COUNTRY.
USE IT TO DO ALL HE CAN TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A TWO-STATE SOLUTION.
THAT PLAN THAT HE HAS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LAND GRAB.
I KNOW WHO HE IS. I SEE WHAT HE'S DOING.
AND OTHERS DO, TOO. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE WILL TO
STAND IN THE WELL TO SAY IT. HE'S A BENEFICIAL BIGOT. AND THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM HIS
BIGOTRY, THEY ARE LOYAL TO HIM. PEOPLE WHO WOULD NEVER ALLOW A
PERSON TO DO SUCH A THING IF HE HADN'T DONE FAVORS FOR THEM. THEY WOULD SPEAK OUT AND SPEAK
UP AGAINST HIS BIGOTRY BUT THEY DON'T BECAUSE HE'S DONE FAVORS.
THOSE WHO ARE PART OF THE EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT, THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE COUNTRY.
THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREACH ON SUNDAY, ALL OF THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS. AND THEN ON MONDAY, THEY BENEFIT FROM THE BIGOTRY. AND AS A RESULT, RIGHTEOUSNESS
BECOMES SECONDARY TO THE LOYALTY THAT THEY PLEDGED BECAUSE HE DID
SOMETHING FOR THEM. SO I'M SAYING TO YOU, DEAR
FRIENDS, IN THIS PART OF MY MESSAGE TODAY, I'M NOT GOING TO
RELENT. THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE ME GO AWAY. THERE ARE SOME WHO ALREADY
INDICATED -- THERE WAS A NEWS STORY TODAY ABOUT HOW I'LL BE DEFEATED AT THE NEXT ELECTION
AND I'LL JUST BECOME A PART OF A BYGONE HISTORY.
THEY'VE ALREADY PROGNOSTICATED MY DEFEAT, CALLED ME A ROGUE. WELL, FRIENDS, ALL OF THIS MAY
HAPPEN BUT I'LL SAY THIS TO YOU, IT WON'T CHANGE MY OPINIONS, AND
IT WON'T CHANGE WHO I AM. I BELIEVE IN THIS FLAG. I BELIEVE IN LIBERTY AND JUSTICE
FOR ALL. I DON'T SUPPORT BENEFICIAL BIGOTRY. I DON'T SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO WOULD
DESECRATE WHAT THE FLAG REALLY MEANS AS IT RELATES TO THE CONSTITUTION. THOSE WERE NOT THE LAST ARTICLES
OF IMPEACHMENT THAT WILL BE BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR. THOSE YESTERDAY, H.RES. 939,
THEY'RE NOT THE LAST TO BE BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE
TO REMOVE DONALD JOHN TRUMP FROM OFFICE. MR. SPEAKER, I YIELD BACK THE
BALANCE OF MY TIME.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS. MEMBERS ARE REMINDED TO REFRAIN FROM ENGAGING IN PERSONALITIES
TOWARDS THE PRESIDENT.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS SEEK RECOGNITION? MR. ROY: MR. SPEAKER, FIRST, BEFORE I BEGIN, I ASK UNANIMOUS
CONSENT WHEN THE HOUSE ADJOURNS TODAY, IT ADJOURN TO MEET AT NOON, MONDAY NEXT, FOR MORNING
HOUR DEBATE AND 2:00 P.M. FOR LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: WITHOUT OBJECTION.
UNDER THE SPEAKER'S ANNOUNCED POLICY OF JANUARY 3, 2025, THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, MR. ROY, IS RECOGNIZED FOR 60 MINUTES AS
THE DESIGNEE OF THE MAJORITY LEADER. MR. ROY: I THANK THE SPEAKER.
AND IT'S GREAT TO HAVE HAD THE CHANCE LAST NIGHT TO BE AT THE
WHITE HOUSE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HIS CABINET, MY COLLEAGUES,
OBVIOUSLY CELEBRATING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON. AND OUR COLLECTIVE BELIEF THAT
THIS SEASON IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE IN RECOGNITION OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND AS A JUDEO-CHRISTIAN SOCIETY IN
CELEBRATING THE BIRTH OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST AND IT'S NOT JUST A HOLIDAY FOR
WHITE LIGHTS AND GARLAND AND MAKING MERRY. IT IS A HOLIDAY THAT SERVES AT
THE CENTER OF WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AS THE SPEAKER KNOWS S SITTING THERE IN THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR
UNDER, "IN GOD WE TRUST, "IT IS THAT COLLECTIVE FAITH WE HAVE IN
THE LORD ALMIGHTY AND OUR COLLECTIVE BELIEF IN HIS SON THAT HAS SERVED AT THE CORE OF
THE STRENGTH OF THIS COUNTRY FROM ITS FOUNDING. AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO THINGS TODAY THAT ARE RELATED TO
THAT. ONE IS A POLICY ISSUE, THE ISSUE
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO GET HEALTH CARE AND CARE FOR EACH OTHER, AND THE OTHER IS
DEFENDING OUR JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE AND WESTERN CIVILIZATION FROM THE ONSLAUGHT OF THOSE WHO WISH TO PUSH THE
ISLAMIFICATION OF OUR COUNTRY INTO THE FOREFRONT. AND I'M GOING TO START ON THE
POINT OF THE POLICY OF HEALTH CARE BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES TO
THE CENTRAL PROBLEM WE FACE AS A PEOPLE RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TALKING
ABOUT, QUOTE, AFFORDABILITY. IT'S BECOME THE POLITICAL HOT
BUTTON BUZZWORD. IT'S BEING DRIVEN INTENTIONALLY
BY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT VIRTUALLY NOTHING TO
RUN ON. AND SO THEY MADE A CHOICE TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN IN
ORDER TO SET UP A FIGHT AND TO TRY TO ELEVATE THE ISSUE OF
HEALTH CARE, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN WIN ON IT POLITICALLY. SO I WANT EVERYBODY TO THINK
ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE. THEY SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO POLITICIZE
THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE, NOT ACTUALLY WORK TO SOLVE THE
PROBLEM. REPUBLICANS, IN MY VIEW, HAVE
AVOIDED THE ISSUE OF HEALTH CARE OUT OF POLITICAL FEAR,
HISTORICALLY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS REPUBLICAN
CONGRESS, THIS REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND SENATE, AND THIS
REPUBLICAN-LED WHITE HOUSE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO
TRANSFORM HEALTH CARE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SO IT CAN BE AFFORDABLE, SO THAT THEY CAN
HAVE CHOICE, SO THAT THEY CAN GO TO A DOCTOR OF THEIR CHOICE, TO EMPOWER DOCTORS AND PATIENTS,
NOT INSURANCE BUREAUCRATS AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS.
RIGHT NOW, THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY IS GETTING
CRUSHED UNABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE BECAUSE DEMOCRATS BROKE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
DEMOCRATS KNOWINGLY CHOSE TO BREAK THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 15 YEARS AGO.
WE'VE TOLD THE WORLD WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND IT HAS COME TRUE.
AMERICAN FAMILIES AND THE BUSINESSES THAT EMPLOY MOST OF THEM, THEY ARE SPENDING ABOUT
$25,000 A YEAR FOR INSURANCE PREMIUMS THAT GIVE THEM FEWER
OPTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THEY CAN DO, HIGHER CO-PAYS,
HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE ACTUAL CARE.
I GO BACK TO MY POINT IN GOD WE TRUST AND CELEBRATING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON, AS CHRISTIANS,
WE ARE CALLED TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN WE ARE. WE ARE CALLED TO HELP THOSE WHO
NEED HELP. THAT IS WHY YOU IF YOU GO LOOK AT SOME MANY OF OUR HOSPITALS
THERE ARE NONPROFITS BUILT UP FROM FAITH-CENTERED
INSTITUTIONS. CHRISTIANS CAME TOGETHER TO SAY WE SHOULD CARE FOR THOSE WHO NEED HELP. BUT THEN CAME IN GOVERNMENT AND
ALL OF ITS INFINITE WISDOM, GOVERNMENT CAME IN AND REGULATED
HEALTH CARE, RESTRICTED OUR OPTIONS AND SOCIALIZED THE PAYMENTS. AND NOW WHAT IS THE RESULT?
AN IMPOSSIBLE BUILT FOR AN AMERICAN FAMILY TO GET HEALTH CARE OF THEIR CHOICE OR GET
INSURANCE THAT WILL GIVE THEM COMFORT, THAT THE CANCER THAT I
GOT IN 2011 HITS THEM, THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GO GET CARE
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND CAN'T AFFORD IT BECAUSE THEY
BROKE IT. AND RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS HAVE A CHOICE, GO ALONG WITH DEMOCRATS
TO CONTINUE TO SOCIALIZE HEALTH CARE, CONTINUE TO ENRICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, CONTINUE TO
TAKE AWAY OPTIONS FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OR STAND UP FOR HEALTH CARE EXTEME AND STAND UP
FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY TO GO TO THE DOCTOR OF THEIR
CHOICE, GET INSURANCE, GO TO
MEDISHARE AND DEFRAY COSTS RATHER THAN HAVING CONSTRAINED,
REGULATED, NO-OPTION, EXPENSIVE HEALTH MANAGEMENT BY BUREAUCRATS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE.
THE FACT IS, THERE'S THIS BIG DEBATE RIGHT NOW ABOUT SO-CALLED
SUBSIDIES. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, COVID-ERA
CASH THROWN OUT TO OUR ECONOMY FOR PLUSUPS FOR SUBSIDIES FOR
THE BROKEN OBAMACARE SYSTEM. AND NOW, WE ARE FIVE YEARS
REMOVED FROM COVID, AND MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES ARE TRYING TO SAY THAT IF WE DON'T EXTEND
THOSE SUBSIDIES, SOMEHOW WE ARE DENYING PEOPLE HEALTH CARE.
THAT'S JUST FLAT FALSE. IT'S A LIE. THE FACT IS, OBAMACARE REMAINS
IN PLACE. ITS SUBSIDIES' STRUCTURE REMAINS IN PLACE, FOR BETTER OR WORSE.
AND THOSE SUBSIDIES THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT WOULD LITALLY GO INTO THE POCKETS OF INSURANCE
COMPANIES. WHOSE PROFITS ARE UP 1,000-PLUS PERCENT OVER THE LAST DECADE.
IT IS AN INSURANCE ENRICHMENT SCHEME. MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES BROKE
HEALTH CARE AND DOWN HERE SAYING WE MUST GIVE.
MR. MORRISON: MONEY TO INSURANCE COMPANIES AND ANY REPUBLICAN WHO GOES ALONG WITH THAT, NEEDS TO
ANSWER FOR DOING THE SAME THING. WHY WOULD WE GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT
SADDLED UP WITH GOVERNMENT TO ENRICH THEMSELVES RATHER THAN HELP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
85% OF ALL AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
REVENUES INSURANCE RECEIVED COMES FROM THE TAXPAYERS. 85% OF ALL OF THE REVENUE, I
SHOULD SAY, THAT THE INSURERS RECEIVE ARE COMING FROM THE
FEDERAL TAXPAYERS. INSURERS RECEIVE AT LEAST $A 35
BILLION IN FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IN 2024 TORE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T USE
THEIR PLAN A SINGLE TIME. $35 BILLION WENT INTO THE
POCKETS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T USE THEIR
PLAN. I WANT TO SAY THIS, THEN I'M GOING TO YIELD TO MY FRIEND FROM
MISSOURI, WE HAVE SOLUTIONS. WHEN PEOPLE SAY REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A PLAN, IT'S FALSE.
WE HAVE PUT OUT PLANS. WE'VE PUT OUT SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE SOLUTIONS.
WE BELIEVE IN EXPANDING PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO CARE BY EMPOWERING
THEM WITH THE SAME TAX TREATMENT, EQUAL TAX TREATMENT THAT CORPORATIONS GET.
INDIVIDUALS SHOULD GET THE SAME TAX DEDUCTIONS AND TAX BREAKS IN
ORDER TO HAVE HEALTH CARE. WE BELIEVE IN EXPANDED HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT YOU CAN
USE FOR DIRECT PRIMARY CARE TO GO TO THE DOCTOR, HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT DOCTOR
AND NOT BE PUT IN A COMPLICATED SCHEME WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET APPROVAL FOR SON IN NETWORK OR
OUT OF NETWORK, WE WANT AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE EMPOWERED.
WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO DEFRAY COSTS AND SHARE COST IN
ALL THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FRANKLY THE LAST LIFEBOAT THAT PEOPLE
HAVE RIGHT NOW FOR ACCESS TO CARE. WE WANT TO ALLOW PROVIDERS TO
OWN HOSPITALS RATHER THAN BEING RESTRICTED FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. SO THE CORPORATE MONOLITHIC
HOSPITALS ARE THE ONLY OPTION. WE WANT A THOUSAND FLOWERS TO
BLOOM FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE FREEDOM OPTION. GUESS WHAT? YOU CAN LEAVE OBAMACARE, THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT STRUCTURE ALL IN PLACE, LEAVE IT ALL
SITTING THERE, BUT JUST PROVIDE THE AMERICAN FAMILY WITH A
FREEDOM OPTION. ALLOW THEM TO HAVE CHOICE. SHOULDN'T THAT BE OURITE IN
AMERICA? PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A RIGHT TO HEALTH CARE. WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SAYING IS
THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE RATHER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL, THE FAMILY
BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO GET THE CARE OF THEIR CHOICE.
WHAT ON EARTH KIND OF FREEDOM DO YOU HAVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE YOU
LITERALLY CAN'T GET HEALTH CARE, YOU ARE PROHIBITED FROM IT. THE GOVERNMENT HAS STOPPED US
FROM EXERCISING OUR FREEDOM. WE HAVE PLANS. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS THE
BACKBONE AND THE WILL POWER TO STAND UP AND DELIVER. AND I SAY DO IT NOW.
I SAY STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR HEALTH CARE FREEDOM NOW. I'M TIRED OF IT.
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER ELECTION. DON'T WORRY, WE'LL DO IT NEXT
TIME. I WANT TO DO IT NOW BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AT THE HANDS OF A BUREAUCRACY AND
TYRANNY OF GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTH MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN THE ABILITY TO GET CARE.
THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH RESPECT TO HEALTH CARE RESISTS
ON RECORD OF VOTE AND POLICIES BECAUSE MY DEMOCRAT POLICIES PUT FORWARD POLICIES THAT THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO LIVE UNDER TODAY. THEY BROKE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.
MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ARE PROPOSING AN INSURANCE ENRICHMENT SCHEME AND PRINTING
MONEY IN THE TREASURY AND GIVING IT TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. THEIR SOLUTION TO HEALTH CARE IS
ENRICHING INSURANCE COMPANY. OUR SOLUTION IS EMPOWERING PEOPLE. OUR SOLUTION FOR HEALTH CARE IS
SPREADING COSTS OUT AMONG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HELP EACH OTHER OUT. THAT'S WHY I STARTED TALKING
ABOUT CHRISTMAS. THE QUESTION FOR REPUBLICANS IS, IF NOT NOW, WHEN?
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO STAND UP AND DELIVER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THAT BASIC RIGHT, I WILL
SAY IT, RIGHT TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE OF OUR CHOICE WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT INTERFERING, WITHOUT GOVERNMENT REGULATING, WITHOUT STEALING OUR ABILITY TO CARE
TORE OUR OWN FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES IN OUR COMMUNITY. I KNOW MY FRIEND FROM MISSOURI
FEELS THE SAME WAY. HE HAS DN INCREDIBLE WORK ON THIS SUBJECT. WE ARE ALIGNED I THINK ALMOST
ENTIRELY ON THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS TO LEAD, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS TO
STAND UP AND DELIVER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ON HEALTH CARE FREEDOM FOR EVERY AMERICAN.
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN SUCH
TIME AS HE MAY CONSUME.
MR. BURLISON: TODAY I RISE TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT ISSUES FACING THE AMERICAN
FAMILY TODAY WHICH IS HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. UNDER THE BIDE GENERAL
ADMINISTRATION INFLATION SURGED THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN DECADES AND HEALTH CARE COSTS ROSE ALONG
WITH IT, DRIVING PREMIUMS, DEDUCT I BELIEVE AND PREMIUMS
HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER, WHETHER YOU ARE AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN OR WHETHER YOU
ARE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET, IT DOESN'T MATTER. THE ENTIRE THING HAS BEEN
DESTROYED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEIR SCHEMES. FOR YEARS, WASHINGTON HAS TOLD
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT IF WE JUST SPEND MORE, IF WE MANDATE MORE, JUST REGULATE MORE, HEALTH
CARE WILL SOMEHOW BECOME CHEAPER AND SIMPLER AND MORE HUMANE. BUT THAT PROMISE CLEARLY HAS
FAILED IN A SPECTACULAR WAY. WE ARE WATCHING IT FAIL -- GO
OUT IN FLAMES AS WE SPEAK. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS SOLD
AS A SOLUTION. IT HAS LOCKED FAMILIES INTO A SYSTEM WHERE PREMIUMS KEEP
RISING AND NETWORKS SHRINK AND THEY ARE LEFT WITH COVERAGE THEY CAN'T EVEN USE AND BILLS THEY
CAN'T EVEN PREDICT. THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY IN THE COST IN THE HEALTH CARE THEY ARE
RECEIVING IS. LET'S BE HONEST ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, HEALTH CARE NOW
CONSUMES ONE-FIFTH OF OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY AND HOSPITAL PRICES HAVE
RISEN THREE TIMES FASTER THAN THE AWFUL INFLATION THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING AS A MEAN.
INSURANCE PREMIUMS HAVE SOARED AND PATIENTS STILL STRUGGLE TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR.
THEY STILL WAIT WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND
FACE SURPRISE BILLS EVEN WHEN THEY TOLL ALL OF THE RULES. THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT.
WASHINGTON INFLATED THE DEMAND WITH SUBSIDIES AND MANDATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CHOKING
OFF THE SUPPLY THROUGH REGULATION, LICENSING BARRIERS AND PROTECTION OF ENTRENCHED
INTEREST. WHEN GOVERNMENT POURS TAXPAYER DOLLARS INTO A SYSTEM THAT
RESTRICTS COMPETITION, PRICES RISE, EFFICIENCY COLLAPSES AND
ACCOUNTABILITY DISAPPEARS. AND THROUGH IT ALL, THE ONE GROUP THAT WAS SYSTEM ATICALLY
EXCLUDED FROM DECISION MAKING IS THE PATIENT THEMSELVES. THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW OF
THIS CURRENT SYSTEM. AMERICANS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CONTROL THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE
DOLLARS, INSTEAD THOSE DOLLARS ARE ROUTED THROUGH INSURERS,
EMPLOYERS AND INSURANCE AGENCIES THAT NEVER FEEL THE PAIN OF THE COSTS OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES
ORDEAL WITH THE TIME RESTRAINTS. MR. SPEAKER, WHEN WE DON'T CONTROL THE MONEY, YOU DON'T
CONTROL THE CHOICES. AND CONTRARY TO THE CLAIM THAT
MY FRIEND FROM COLLEAGUE FROM TEXAS HAS MENTIONED TAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEAS, THAT IS NOT AT
ALL THE CASE. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPONSORED YEAR
AFTER YEAR BY THOUGHT LEADERS LIKE THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS, BUT YET THEY HAVEN'T COME TO THE
FLOOR FOR A VOTE. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN AMPLE OPPORTUNITY. I AM GLAD TO SEE NOW THERE IS AN
APPETITE FOR THIS DISCUSSION, BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS ALREADY FILLED WITH SERIOUS ACTIONABLE
REFORMS THAT GIVE AMERICANS REAL OPTIONS BEYOND OBAMACARE. I RECENTLY CO-SIGNED A LETTER BY
REPRESENTATIVE BIGGS THAT HIGHLIGHTED 14 DISTINCT REFORM BILLS THAT ARE OUT THERE ALL OF
WHICH PRESENT MUCH BETTER, MORE AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS THAN THE
CURRENT DISASTER OF OBAMACARE. AND THAT IS WHY I AM PROMOTING A
NEW FRAMEWORK CALLED MAHA, MAKE
AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN, RESTORES CHOICE AND TRANSPARENCY AND
AFFORDABILITY WITHOUT EXPANDING GOVERNMENT CONTROL OR TOSSERRING ANYONE TO GIVE UP THEIR CURRENT
COVERAGE. IT IS BUILT ON TWO SIMPLE IDEAS. MAHA ACCOUNTS WHICH IS TAX-FREE
HEALTH ACCOUNT THAT PUTS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES BACK IN CHARGE OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING.
THIS IS FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE THINGS THAT OUR PRESIDENT HAS
TRUTHED. STOP GIVING THE MONEY TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. GIVE THE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE. THESE ACCOUNTS ALLOW FOR
AMERICANS TO SAVE AND SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY ON THE CARE THAT THEY ACTUALLY CHOOSE.
THE INSURANCE PREMIUMS THAT THEY WANT TO PAY, THE DIRECT PRIMARY
CARE, LONG-TERM CARE AND WELLNESS EXPENSES LIKE HEALTHY FOOD AND FITNESS.
IMAGINE ENCOURAGING AMERICANS IMAGINE AMERICANS TAKING THEIR
PRETAX DOLLARS TO BUY THE HEALTHY FOOD THAT WILL SUSTAIN THEIR FAMILIES.
AND THE UNUSED FUNDS ROLLOVER AND CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GROW TAX-FREE WITHIN THESE ACCOUNTS
AND A FAMILY CAN HELP A NEIGHBOR IN NEED THROUGH A ADVANCED TAXABLE CHARITABLE SUPPORT.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT MICROMANAGEMENT FROM WASHINGTON BUT ABOUT RESTORING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND REAL
PURCHASING POWER. SECOND PART OF MAHA IS THE
INSURANCE. WHICH IT WILL BE A NEW AFFORDABLE INSURANCE OPTION PARAMEDIC WITH THESE ACCOUNTS
THAT EMPHASIZES TRANSPARENCY, COMPETITION, AND CATASTROPHIC PROTECTION RATHER THAN ALL THE
BLOATED MANDATES. THESE PLANS ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY REQUIREMENTS THAT
HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO FAIL AND DRIVE UP THE COSTS IN OBAMACARE.
IT WILL CAP EXCESSIVE PROVIDER PRICING, EXPAND ACCESS THROUGH TELEHEALTH AND WORK FORCE
REFORMS AND GUARANTEE COVERAGE WITHOUT ANNUAL OR LIFETIME BENEFITS. TOGETHER, THE MAHA ACCOUNTS AND
MAHA INSURANCE OFFERS SOMETHING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT NEVER DID, A REAL ALTERNATIVE.
LET'S BE CLEAR, THIS DOES NOT FORCE ANYONE TO ABANDON THEIR
CURRENT COVERAGE. IF YOU LIKE THE CRAPPY A.C.A. OBAMACARE PLAN YOU CURRENTLY
HAVE, YOU CAN KEEP IT. BUT AMERICANS DESERVE ANOTHER OPTION, ONE THAT TREATS THEM LIKE AN ADULT, NOT LINE ITEMS IN
A FEDERAL SPREADSHEET. MR. SPEAKER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF BEING TOLD THAT CONFUSION IS INEVITABLE, THAT
HIGH COSTS ARE UNAVOIDABLE, AND THAT WASHINGTON KNOWS BETTER THAN THEY DO. THEY'RE TIRED OF A SYSTEM THAT
PROTECTS INSURERS AND INSTITUTIONS AND LOBBYISTS WHILE FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS
MEET. GIVE THE PEOPLE CONTROL OVER THEIR HEALTH CARE DOLLARS. IT'S NOT A RADICAL CONCEPT.
IT'S HOW MARKETS WORK. IT'S HOW INNOVATION HAPPENS AND
COSTS COME DOWN. THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE. WE CAN CONTINUE DOUBLING DOWN ON A FAILING SYSTEM THAT PROMISES
COVERAGE BUT LITTLE CARE, OR WE CAN OFFER AMERICANS A NEW PATH, ONE GROUNDED IN FREEDOM, ONE
GROUNDED IN RESPONSIBILITY, AND TRUST IN THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. MR. SPEAKER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
THIS VERY CLEAR, MR. SPEAKER. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T WANT REPUBLICANS TO DO HALF MEASURES
OR TO TINKER AROUND THE EDGES. THEY DON'T WANT EXCUSES. THEY WANT LEADERSHIP, AND THEY
WANT BOLD ACTION. THEY WANT POLITICIANS TO STOP WRITING BLANK CHECKS FOR A
BROKEN SYSTEM AND FINALLY DELIVER THE KIND OF TRANSFORMATIVE HEALTH CARE SOLUTIONS THAT THIS COUNTRY AND
THESE PEOPLE DESERVE. ANYTHING LESS BORDERS ON POLITICAL MALFEASANCE. AND WITH THAT I YIELD BACK AND
THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM TEXAS FOR ALLOWING ME THIS TIME. MR. ROY: I KNOW MY FRIEND FROM
MISSOURI NEEDS TO HEAD HOME. BEFORE HE HEADS OUT, I'D ASK HIM A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS IN
COLLOQUY. FOR THE AVERAGE VIEWER OUT
THERE, THEY CAN'T FOLLOW ALL THIS BUT WE'LL DISSTILL IT DOWN
SIMPLY. WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY PROPOSING IS INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES, INDIVIDUALS, BE ABLE TO GET THE SAME TAX BENEFIT AS CURRENTLY
CORPORATIONS GET WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR DOLLARS INTO A BLUE CROSS OR AETNA OR SOME
OTHER INSURANCE PLAN, RIGHT? >> RIGHT. MR. ROY: INSTEAD OF HAVING AN
EMPLOYER BY A BROKEN SYSTEM CREATED BY WAGE CONTROLS POST WORLD WAR II, INSTEAD OF
EMPLOYERS ONLY BEING ABLE TO GET THE TAX BREAK WHEN THEY GIVE
DOLLARS INTO -- TO PAY BLUE CROSS TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF PLAN, AND THEN YOU HAVE TO
FURTHER SUBSIDIZE THAT, RIGHT? SO MAYBE YOUR EMPLOYER PUTS IN $1,800 AND YOU PUT IN $900 AND
TOTAL IT'S COSTING YOU $2700 A MONTH. INSTEAD, WE'RE SAYING LOOK, GET
THE SAME TAX BREAK, EMPLOYER, BUT PUT IT INTO A MASSIVELY
EXPANDED TAX-FREE ACCOUNT WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO USE IT FOR
INSURANCE, REAL INSURANCE THAT YOU CAN GO GET, CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE, AND/OR DIRECT PRIMARY
CARE, ALL SORTS OF PLANS OUT THERE WHERE YOU HAVE A DOCTOR THAT SAYS LOOK, FOR $100 A MONTH YOU CAN CALL ME, I'M AT YOUR
CALL, I'LL DO THIS KIND OF SERVICE, AND/OR HEALTH SHARING, WHETHER IT'S SECULAR OR
FAITH-BASED, WHERE YOU HAVE -- WAIT A MINUTE, I DON'T NEED CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE FOR THIS PROBLEM. IT'S A BROKEN LEG.
BUT I DON'T HAVE HADS 5,000 FOR THE EMERGENCY ROOM -- HAVE HADS
5,000 FOR THE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT AND WHATNOT SO YOU SHARE THAT COST AMONG PEOPLE IN A
FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATION OFTEN, BUT SOMETIMES SECULAR. SO ISN'T THAT THE ENGINE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?
>> ABSOLUTELY. AM I ALLOWED -- MR. ROY: YEAH.
>> ANY REFORM WE'RE LOOKING AT, IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT AS THE CORE ENGINE, WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE.
MR. ROY: WOULD IT NOT REQUIRE US TO SAY YOU CAN LEAVE OBAMACARE IN PLACE, THAT CAN SIT THERE AND
KEEP DOING WHAT IT'S DOING, BUT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THIS OPTION SO EMPLOYERS CAN PUT IT
IN THERE AND IF YOU'RE SELF-EMPLOYED YOU CAN GET THE SAME TAX BREAK. ALL EQUAL TAX TREATMENT.
NOBODY IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY. AND WE WOULD HAVE A PRODUCT OVER HERE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR TRUE
CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE, RIGHT? NOT REGULATED OR ALL SORTS OF COMPLICATIONS AND NOT TELLING YOU WHAT YOU CAN OR CANNOT DO
BUT A RISK-BASED PRODUCT SAYING HI, I'M A HEALTHY 24-YEAR-OLD, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M
IN A BAD ACCIDENT OR I GET CANCER THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE CARE, AND I WILL PAY $100 A
MONTH FOR THAT RISK ASSESSMENT, AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN FIGURE ALL THAT OUT, OR $200 A
MONTH, BUT NOT $2,000 A MONTH, ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?
>> ABSOLUTELY. WHEN YOU GIVE THE CHOICE BACK TO THE PEOPLE, SUDDENLY THE DOCTORS WILL START PAYING ATTENTION AS
WELL. MR. ROY: CORRECT. MR. BURLISON: AND THE PEOPLE ASK
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST, AND THEY HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT RIGHT THEN AND THERE. AND AND YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU
CAN WALK AWAY AND GO DOWN THE STREET UNTIL PEOPLE START PROVIDING THE PRICING. THAT WILL FORCE TRANSPARENCY.
MR. ROY: AND THE LAST POINT, TO THAT POINT, WHEN OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN PARTICULAR AND OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES, THEY TALK
ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS, WE NEED TRANSPARENCY AND WE NEED AN ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS, I
SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY. WE NEED TO FIX SOME PARTICULAR TECHNICAL THING WITH OUR EXISTING PLANS, RIGHT?
WHATEVER THESE LITTLE SOLUTIONS ARE, P.B.M.'S, RIGHT? WE'LL DO SOMETHING ON P.B.M.'S,
AND SOMETIMES THAT WORKS, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. WILL ANY OF THAT BE TRANSFORM
ATIVE? , WHAT WILL BE TRANSFORMATIVE IS GIVING INDIVIDUALS AND PATIENTS THE POWER TO DEPLOY THE DOLLARS
IN A TAX ADVANTAGED WAY IN A MARKETPLACE WHERE THEY CAN GO GET THE OPTIONS THAT'S BEST FOR
THEM, CORRECT? MR. BURLISON: CORRECT. IN FACT, THE SWAMPY THING TO DO, WHAT YOU'D EXPECT THIS TOWN TO
NORMALLY DO IS TO TINKER WITH THOSE THINGS AND DO WHAT THE
CONVENTIONAL THOUGHT WAS BEFORE, LET'S TINKER WITH P.B.M.'S OR THIS ACCOUNT OR THIS, AND THE
END RESULT WILL BE LESS CHOICE FOR PATIENTS AND HIGHER COSTS. EVEN WITH P.B.M.'S, IT WILL
RAISE PREMIUMS. MR. ROY: RIGHT. IF YOU HAVE AN F-250 PICKUP, RIGHT, AND YOU HAVE A CRAPPY
LITTLE ENGINE IN THERE THAT DOESN'T WORK, BUT YOU ADD FOUR WHEEL DRIVE AND ADD LEATHER
SEATS AND DO ALL THE STUFF TO MAKE IT A NICE TRUCK BUT IT'S GOT A LAWN MOWER ENGINE IN IT,
WOULD IT WORK AND BE EFFECTIVE? MR. BURLISON: NO. MR. ROY: THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS DO, PLEASE GIVE ME THE LEATHER SEATS ON THE F-250 OR I REALLY WANT
THE FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE OR GOOD BED LINER AND BED COVER, GIVE ME THE OPTIONS AND MUSIC AND SPEAKERS.
YEAH, THAT LOOKS GREAT. GREAT RUNNING BOARDS. BUT YOU'VE GOT A FRICKIN' LAWN
MOWER ENGINE, THE TRUCK'S USELESS. WE'VE GOT TO ACTUALLY TRANSFORM HEALTH CARE AND WE HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT WITH PROPOSALS LIKE YOURS, LIKE MINE, LIKE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS OUR
COLLEAGUES HAVE. THE QUESTION IS, WILL WE HAVE THE WILLPOWER TO DO WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT, WHICH IS
STOP SUBSIDIZING INSURANCE COMPANIES, STOP ENRICHING INSURANCE BUREAUCRATS AND
EMPOWER THE AMERICAN SAMOA PEOPLE? MR. BURLISON: ABSOLUTELY. MR. ROY: I THANK YOU FOR YOUR
TIME. I WISH YOU SAFE TRAVEL TO MISSOURI AND HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK WE CAN MARILYN GETAS GET -- WE
CAN GET TO SAVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. AND I WANT TO GET TO A CRITICAL
ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND THAT IS THE FACT
THAT AMERICA AND THE WESTERN CIVILIZATION IS UNDER ATTACK
FROM WITHIN, THE CHEAP LABOR LOBBY, LEFT-WING N.G.O.'S,
RADICAL PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS, MARXISTS, GLOBALIST ORGANIZATIONS, UNITED NATIONS,
THEY'VE MOBILIZED A COORDINATED EFFORT TO SUBVERT OUR SECURITY,
OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM TO HARM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
PARTICULARLY CONCERNING IS THE THREAT POSED BY ISLAMISTS
SPREADING SHALL RIA LAW --
SPREADING SARIA LAW AND NOT
ASSIMILATING INTO THE AMERICAN LIFE. THIS IS A POLITICAL MOVEMENT, WELL-FUNDED, TARGETED AT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WESTERN
CIVILIZATION, THE RULE OF LAW, AND OUR CONSTITUTION.
HE WE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE INTO THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE ADHERENT ON SHALL --
THREA LAW -- SHALL RIA -- SHARIA LAW.
THE KOREAN IS OUR LAW, JIHAD IS OUR WAY, DYING IN THE WAY OF THE
LAW IS OUR HIGHEST HOPE.
MEANWHILE, EUROPE HAS FALLEN, LONDON, PARIS, MERE SHELVES OF
THEIR FORMER STRONG SELF. YOU WATCH VETERANS WHO FOUGHT TO DEFEND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND
WORLD WAR II, THOSE STILL ALIVE TEAR UP AND CRY WONDERING WHAT IT WAS THEY FOUGHT FOR WHEN THEY
WATCH THE RADICAL EXTENSION OF ISLAM INTO THE STREETS OF LONDON
AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN FRANCE, A MAJORITY OF YOUNG
FRENCH MUSLIMS PUT SHARIA ABOVE THEIR OWN NATIONAL LAWS AND MORE THAN A 1/3 HAVE SYMPATHY FOR
ISLAMIFICATION. THERE IS A THREAT TO OUR
NATIONAL COHESION. THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORT TO MAKE KRON IDENTIFIED THE FEDERATIONS OF MUSLIMS OF
FRANCE, F.M.F., AS PART OF THE HISTORIC BROTHERHOOD PROMOTED
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO TO RETURN TO CORE ISLAMIC VALUES. THEY SAID THE F.M.F. CONTROLLED
139 PLACES OF WORSHIP IN FRANCE AND A FURTHER 68 AFFILIATED AND
AN ALL AROUND 7% OF THE TOTAL AND THE ORGANIZATION RAN SOME 280 ASSOCIATIONS. SEVEN OUT OF 10 FRENCH VOTERS
WOULD BACK A BAN ON THE ISLAMIC VEIL IN PUBLIC BECAUSE OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING IN FRANCE. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, MUSLIMS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO
BRITAIN'S SHARIA COURTS WHICH ARE NOT PART OF U.K. LAW AND OPERATE AS INFORMAL BODIES.
THE NUMBER OF SHARIA COURTS IN BRITAIN HAVE GROWN TO 85 SINCE THE FIRST BEGAN OPERATING IN THE
COUNTRY IN 1982. POLLS HAVE FOUND THAT 41% OF THE BRITISH PUBLIC BELIEVE MUSLIM
IMMIGRANTS HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE UNITED KINGDOM. NEARLY HALF THINK MUSLIM WOMEN
ARE PRESSURED INTO WEARING THE HIJAB AND MORE THAN 1/3 THINK IT
CONTRIBUTES TO VIOLENCE. PARALLEL LEGAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT KEY TO THE SOCIETY.
THERE MUST BE ONE RULE OF LAW FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE. ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1991, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, THE
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ISSUED A MEMORANDUM ABOUT NORTH AMERICA DETAILING A PLAN FOR, QUOTE, THE
ENABLEMENT OF ISLAM IN NORTHERN AMERICA, ESTABLISHING A EFFECTIVE AND STABLE ISLAMIC
MOVEMENT LED BY THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WHICH ADOPTS MUSLIM CAUSES DOMESTICALLY AND GLOBALLY
AND WORKS TO EXPAND THE OBSERVANT MUSLIM BASE. IT WAS A COORDINATED EFFORT TO
ADVANCE ISLAM INTO THE UNITED STATES. OUR FOUNDERS DID NOT ENVISION A
NATION THAT REMOTELY RESEMBLED TODAY'S MUSLIM WORLD AND THE RADICAL ELEMENTS OF SHARIA.
AMERICA WAS FOUNDED AS A NATION GROUNDED IN A DISTINCTLY
JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HISTORY AND UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN NATURE. IT WAS THE UNITED STATES.
IT WAS GREAT BRITAIN THAT LED THE ENDING OF SLAVERY
JOHN ADAMS ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IT
BRINGS NATURE AND NATIONS TO THE KNOWLEDGE, BELIEF AND VENERATION OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE.
THOMAS JEFFERSON AND JOHN ADAMS HINTED AT THE INEXA BUILT WITH
THE VALUES OF MUSLIM NATIONS.
AFTER TALKING ABOUT THE BARBERRY STATES TO MAKE WAR ON NATIONS
AFTER THEY WERE INFORMED IT WAS A REQUIREMENT OF THE KORAN.
JEFFERSON'S PAPERS IN 1786, QUOTE, WE TOOK THE LIBERTY TO
MAKE INQUIRIES TO MAKE WAR UPON NATIONS AND CONSIDERED ALL
MANKIND AS OUR FRIENDS NOR GIVEN US ANY PROVOCATION.
THE AMBASSADOR ANSWER WAS IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE LAWS OF THEIR
PROPHET AND WRITTEN THAT ALL NATIONS WHO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR
AUTHORITY WERE SINNERS AND RIGHT AND DUTY TO MAKE WAR UPON THEM
WHEREVER THEY COULD BE FOUND AND TO MAKE SLAVES OF ALL THEY COULD TAKE AS PRISONERS AND THAT EVERY
MUSLIM WHO SHOULD BE SLAIN IN BATTLE WAS SURE TO GO TO PARADISE.
THAT IS JEFFERSON IN 1786. OUR FOUNDERS KNEW THAT SHARI'A
LAW WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND OUR
VALUES. SHARI'A LAW IS A PROBLEM GROWING IN THE UNITED STATES AND
CERTAINLY IN TEXAS. MY HOME STATE BORE THE BRUNT OF
A MASS MIGRATION UNDER THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A QUIETER ONE OF ISLAMISTS LEVERAGING OUR
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM INCORPORATE INTERESTS TO EXTEND AND USE
DIVERSITY VISAS, CHAIN MIGRATION, H-1-B VISAS TO FLOOD
OUR COUNTRY WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN IT AND HAVE NO
INTENTION IN ASSIMILATING INTO
IT. A NEW MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN TEXAS, NOT EVEN A FEW DAYS OLD, 150,000
SQUARE FOOT MUSLIM COMMUNITY CENTER WAS OPENED IN HOUSTON,
EPIC CITY IN PLANO, OUTSIDE OF DALLAS, HAS RAISED QUESTIONS
ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS TO CREATE A EFFECTIVELY MUSLIM-ONLY
COMMUNITY. OR SHARI'A LAW, NO DOUBT WILL BE
PRACTICED AND NOW RENAMED IT THE MEADOW RATHER THAN THE EAST
PLANO ISLAMIC CENTER, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO GROW IT, EVEN AS
THEY ARE MOSQUES BEING BUILT IN TEXAS EVERY DAY THAN ANY OTHER
STATE IN THE UNION. MEANWHILE, LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES BROADLY. OUR NATION'S FOREIGN-BORN
POPULATION HAS REACHED 51.9 MILLION PEOPLE COMPRISING 16% OF
OUR POPULATION. HIGHEST LEVELS OF PERCENTAGE IN OUR HISTORY. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A SIMILAR
LEVEL OF FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION IN ROUGHLY 1920, WE FROZE
IMMIGRATION. AND LARGELY FOR ABOUT 40 TO 50 YEARS, WE FROZE IT.
AND IT HAS BEEN EXPLODING OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS. I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION
CALLED THE PAUSE ACT TO PAUSE IMMIGRATION AND PAUSE IT UNTIL WE GET OUR HANDS AROUND ALL OF
THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PLAGUING OUR IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM. THE ABUSE OF BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP, TO HAVE
PROFITS-CENTERED WAYS TO CREATE AMERICAN CITIZENS BY COMING HERE, COMING ACROSS THE RIO
GRANDE AND CHILDREN CAN USE RESOURCES, SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, LEGAL SYSTEM RNTION WELFARE.
WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW A BROKEN
VISA SYSTEM TO HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS BE BROUGHT INTO THE UNITED STATES EXPANSIVELY
AND PURPOSELY.
H.-1-B PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXPLOITED NOW FOR YEARS AND MUST BE ABOLISHED OR MASSIVELY
REFORMED. WE OBVIOUSLY STILL HAVE A BADLY BROKEN BORDER THAT IS ONLY CURRENTLY BEING HELD IN CHECK BY
A PRESIDENT AND BY LEADERSHIP IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE DEVOTED TO DOING IT AND ARE
EMPOWERED TO DO IT, BUT ALL OF THE WAYS IN WHICH BIDEN-MAYORKAS
ALLOWED OUR BORDER TO BE OPEN AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS STILL
REMAIN IN PLACE STATUTORILY. CONGRESS CAN FIX IT, WE
HAVEN'T. THE HOUSE PASSED LEGISLATION TWO YEARS AGO BUT IT WAS IN THAT
CONGRESS, H.R. 2, TO MEANINGFULLY CHANGE THE LAW SO IT CAN'T BE EXPLOITED TO
ENDANGER THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE NOT BROUGHT THAT BACK UP AGAIN THIS YEAR. WE SHOULD.
WE SHOULD CODIFY THESE CHANGES.
OUR PRIORITIES MATTER. THE RESULTS OF THIS ARE STARK.
THANKSGIVING WEEK, WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE WEST VIRGINIA
NATIONAL GUARD SERVICE MEMBER, WHO WAS 20 YEARS OLD, STAFF
SERGEANT WOLF 24, SAVAGELY ATTACKED AND SHOT BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE.
SPECIAL LIFT BECKSTROM TRAGICALLY LOST HER LIFE.
THE ATTACKER, AN AFGHAN
NATIONAL, WHO WAS IMPORTED THROUGH THE BIDEN-MAYORKAS
PROGRAM DROVE FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO CARRY OUT THIS ATTACK IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.
OVER 5,000 AFGHANS THROUGH OPERATIONS ALLIES HAVE NATIONAL
SECURITY OR PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. WE ARE IMPORTING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO UNDERMINE AND DESTROY OUR
COUNTRY. AND BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF THIS. THIS IS NOT A DEBATABLE
REALITY. IT'S LITERALLY OCCURRING.
FOR US TO SURVIVE, WE HAVE TO ACT. WE NEED TO PASS THE PAUSE ACT.
WE NEED TO PAUSE IMMIGRATION.
WE NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION LIKE THE BILL THAT I INTRODUCED TO
PRESERVE A SHARI'A-FREE AMERICA AND PROHIBIT THE ENTRY OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE KNOWN WITH SHARI'A LAW WHICH IS DEEPLY IN CONFLICT WITH
OUR VALUE AND LAWS. TAKE AWAY THE TAX STATUS OF CARE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT
HAVE TIES TO TERRORISTS. USING AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOLLARS,
UNITED NATIONS' FUNDING, GEORGE SORROWS FUNDING, FOREIGN
FUNDING, NATION STATES, ALL POURING IN TO ORGANIZATIONS OF
N.G.O.'S DIVING THIS AGENDA. THE ISLAMIST-RED GREEN ALLIANCE
WHO WANTS TO DESTROY AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT.
I HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO TAKE AWAY CARE'S TAX STOT
TUESDAY. WHY ARE WE GIVING THEM TAX BREAKS TO TRY AND DESTROY
AMERICA?
WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE FINAL POINT WHICH I WAS ALLUDING TO ON H.R. 2, THAT IS LEGISLATION TO
COD TIE EFFECTIVELY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING, STOP THE ABUSE OF PAROLE, STOP THE
ABUSE OF ASYLUM, STOP THE ABUSE OF CATCH AND RELEASE AND WAYS IN
WHICH AN EXPLOITED BORDER CAN UNDERMINE OUR SECURITY AND ENDANGER US.
WE CANNOT RELY ON THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO IT. CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT.
CONGRESS NEEDS TO COD TIE IT. CONGRESS NEEDS TO CHANGE IT.
AND STATES AND STATE LEADERS NEED TO STAND UP AND USE THE LEGISLATION THAT WE DID PASS IN
JANUARY TO ENABLE SUIT AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY FAILED TO SECURE THE BORDER THAT
WE INCLUDED IN THE LAKEN RILEY ACT BECAUSE STATES CAN NO LONGER
BE BE BE BE BE BE HOLDEN TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE REPRIEVE UNDER PRESIDENT
TRUMP AND WILL COME TO AN END AND STATES MUST BE EMPOWERED AND HAVE LEADERS WHO ARE WILLING TO
STAND UP AND TIGHT. THEY HAVE TO CHALLENGE THE
SUPREME COURT RULING THAT WE MUST HAVE TAXPAYER FUNDING TO
PAY FOR EDUCATION OF ILLEGAL CHILDREN. WE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO USE
TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND WE SHOULD CHALLENGE THAT SUPREME COURT RULING AND STAND UP TO DEFEND
OUR COUNTRY. THE FACT IS, YOU CAN'T WIN A WAR THAT YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO
RECOGNIZE EXISTS. AND IT IS TRUE AFTER THE
ELECTION OF THE MAYOR IN NEW YORK, MAMDANI, WHAT IS GOING ON
IN DEARBORN AND MINNEAPOLIS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN DALLAS,
HOUSTON, AND SAW UNFOLD IN LONDON PARIS, THERE IS AN ATTACK
ON WESTERN WAY OF LIFE AND STAND UP AND DEFEND IT IF WE ARE TO
CONTINUE TO PASS OUR COUNTRY DOWN TO OUR KIDS AND GRAND KIDS. I YIELD BACK.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS. THE CHAIR LAYS BEFORE THE HOUSE THE FOLLOWING ENROLLED BILLS.
THE CLERK: AN ACT TO EXTEND THE SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-DETERMINATION ACT
OF 2000.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: UNDER THE SPEAKER'S ANNOUNCED POLICY OF JANUARY 3, 2025, THE CHAIR
RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA, MR. KILEY, FOR 30 MINUTES.
MR. KILEY: MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THERE WAS A STATEMENT
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF MY STATE THAT MANY OF US FOUND QUITE
SURPRISING, WHERE RECENTLY SAID THAT LONG BEFORE THAT IT WAS DOGE, CALIFORNIA WAS ALREADY
STREAMLINING GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE EFFICIENT, RESPONSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE.
APPARENTLY CALIFORNIA, BEING A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S VIEW. THIS CAME AS A SURPRISE TO MANY
OF US BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF JUST FIVE YEARS DURING GOVERNOR
NEWSOM'S TENURE, THE STATE BUDGET INCREASED BY $124
BILLION, OVER A 50% INCREASE IN SPENDING WITHOUT REALLY ANY
MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENT IN GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA
RANKING FIRST IN THE NATION IN HOMELESSNESS, IN POVERTY, IN
UNEMPLOYMENT, HAVING SOME OF THE WORST ROADS, SOME OF THE WORST ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN OUR
SCHOOLS. BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST A FEW EXAMPLES THAT I THINK ARE
PARTICULARLY REVEALING WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOW QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE THAT CITIZENS
OF CALIFORNIA ARE RECEIVING AND ALSO TO SOME EXTENT THE LESSONS
THAT WE CAN DRAW FROM THAT HERE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE I THINK CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE
QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT SERVICE, GIVING TAXPAYERS A HIGHER RETURN
ON THEIR TAX DOLLARS REMAINS A VITAL IMPERATIVE. SO REMEMBER, THE GOVERNOR SAID
THAT CALIFORNIA IS A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY, HIS EXACT WORDS.
CALIFORNIA IS STREAMLINING GOVERNMENT TO BE MORE
RESPONSIVE, ACCOUNTABLE. THIS INCLUDES A $128 BILLION
BULLET TRAIN THAT STILL SHOWS NO SIGNS OF COMING INTO EXISTENCE.
NOW THAT'S THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST. THE AMOUNT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SPENT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF $17 BILLION BUT NOW 18 YEARS INTO THIS THING AND
NOT A SINGLE BIT OF TRACK HAS BEEN LAID DESPITE THE MASSIVE SPENDING AND "THE NEW YORKTIMES"
HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE PROJECT ISN'T EVEN ON TRACK TO BE FINISHED THIS CENTURY.
THE STATE AUDITOR IN CALIFORNIA FOUND THAT THE STATE SPENT $24
BILLION TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND COMPLETELY LOST TRACK OF THE
MONEY, COULDN'T SAY WHERE IT WENT AND OUT COMES.
DURING THE TIME THIS SPENDING OCCURRED, HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY
SKYROCKETED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE HAS ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL UNSHELTERED HOMELESS IN
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THE STATE ALSO SQUANDERED $32
BILLION ON UNEMPLOYMENT FRAUD, SO IT'S GOING ON IN MINNESOTA IS
SMALL POTATOES COMPARED TO WHAT WE WITNESSED IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE COVID YEARS WHERE THE
STATE FAILED TO TAKE BASIC FRAUD PROTECTION MEASURES THAT OTHER STATES HAD TAKEN AND AS A RESULT
FRAUDSTERS WERE EASILY ABLE TO USE THE BILLIONS TO FUND FURTHER
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. . . . .
I SAY THERE ARE LESSONS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE IN THE LAST LEGISLATION, THE ONE
MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ENTIRE FIASCO WAS NOMINATED TO BE
SECRETARY IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AND NEVER CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE, SO MAYBE THE LESSON WAS
LEARNED. AND RECENT REPORTS THE $60
MILLION 911 SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN CHARGING
CITIZENS ON THEIR PHONE BILL HAS BEEN SCRAPPED. THEY SPENT $650 MILLION BUILDING
THIS SO-CALLED NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEM, AND OUR SYSTEM DOES VERY MUCH NEED TO BE UPDATED BUT
BECAUSE THE STATE COULDN'T MANAGE TO GET THE TECHNOLOGY RIGHT, IT IS ALL GOING TO WASTE. THOSE FUNDS WILL NEVER BE
RECOVERED. AND OUR 911 SYSTEM REMAINS ANTIQUATED AS A RESULT.
AND BEAR IN MIND, SACRAMENTO IS A STONE'S THROW FROM SILICON VALLEY WHERE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS
REQUIRED HERE IS FAIRLY RUDIMENTARY IN TERMS OF WHAT IS NEEDED.
AND I WOULD JUST MENTION ONE FINAL EXAMPLE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL ITSELF.
BECAUSE OUR GOVERNOR HAS HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT CERTAIN RENOVATIONS GOING ON AT THE
WHITE HOUSE AND YET THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE
APPROVED SEVERAL YEARS AGO A $1.2 BILLION RENOVATION OF THE STATE CAPITOL ITSELF. I VOTED AGAINST THAT MEASURE, BY
THE WAY. BUT NOW THE COST OF THAT SEEMS
TO HAVE BALLOONED AND WE DON'T KNOW EVEN BY HOW MUCH BECAUSE THE STATE IS REFUSING TO SAY,
DESPITE THE PERSISTENT EFFORTS OF LOCAL JOURNALISTS TO GET AN
ANSWER AND OTHER LEGISLATORS AS TO HOW MUCH THIS PROJECT IS COSTING OUR TAXPAYERS, THEY WON'T EVEN SAY HOW MUCH, BUT WE
HAVE GOTTEN SOME HINTS OF SOME OF THE MEASURES THAT THE PROJECT
LEADERS HAVE TAKEN, SUCH AS SHIPPING STONES TO ITALY IN
ORDER TO BE TREATED AND REFINED. SO IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT THIS
PARTICULAR PROJECT IS EXACTLY A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY EITHER. SO I BRING THESE EXAMPLES UP TO
HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR REFORM IN MY HOME STATE, TO REORIENT THE
WAY OUR GOVERNMENT WORKS TOWARDS A PARADIGM OF CITIZEN SERVICE BECAUSE WE SEE CORRUPTION AND
INCOMPETENCE AND SPECIAL INTERESTS AND A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER AGENDAS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF THE USE OF TAX DOLLARS TO
ACTUALLY SERVE OUR CITIZENS. AND INDEED, CALIFORNIA IS THE
EXACT OPPOSITE OF A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY AS WE SACRIFICE THE MOST AND GET THE LEAST IN
RETURN. SO I'LL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO CHANGE THAT PARADIGM IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL
AS TO FIND WAYS TO LEARN FROM IT AND TO REORIENT OUR FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT TOWARDS A MODEL OF CITIZEN SERVICE AND EFFICIENCY AS WELL.
MR. SPEAKER, THIS WEEK I SIGNED A DISCHARGE PETITION TO STOP INSIDER TRADING, TO BAN STOCK TRADING BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
I HAD BEEN A CO-SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE OFFERED BY MY COLLEAGUE
FROM FLORIDA, ANNA PAULINO LUNA, AND WE'VE GOTTEN A NUMBER OF BIPARTISAN CO-SPONSORS FOR IT,
AND YET STILL THE BILL HAS NOT MOVED. IT HAS NOT BEEN BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR BY HOUSE LEADERSHIP.
AND SO I HAVE SIGNED THIS DISCHARGE PETITION, WHICH IS A
LEGISLATIVE MECHANISM BY WHICH
THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE CAN BRING A BILL DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT THE BLESSING OF LEADERSHIP.
AND I HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY INCLINED TO SIGN THESE PETITIONS IN MY FIRST COUPLE YEARS HERE IN
THE HOUSE BUT I HAVE COME TO THE VIEW THEY HAVE BECOME MORE
NECESSARY GIVEN THE HOUSE'S SOMEWHAT DIMINISHED ROLE IN RECENT MONTHS IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY DRIVING POLICY FORWARD.
SO I'VE ALSO SIGNED A COUPLE OTHER PETITIONS RELATED TO THE
HEALTH CARE REFORMS WE'RE SEEKING TO ADVANCE. AND I WAS PARTICULARLY CONCERNED
WHEN I HEARD THE SPEAKER HIMSELF SUGGEST THAT HE MIGHT TRY TO STOP DISCHARGE PETITIONS FROM
HAPPENING ALTOGETHER, WHICH WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA AND WOULD MEAN THE HOUSE IS NO
LONGER TRULY A MAJORTARIAN INSTITUTION. SO I THINK THIS ACTION BY
AFFIRMING THE VALUE OF DISCHARGE PETITIONS, AND BY BRINGING TO
THE FLOOR TO BAN TRADING BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE BOTH IMPORTANT STEPS IN RESTORING
TRUST IN THIS INSTITUTION.
BECAUSE, LET'S FACE IT, CONGRESS IS NOT HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM BY THE AMERICAN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW.
I'VE SEEN POLLS SHOWING CONGRESS' APPROVAL RATING IS AROUND 15%. IN MANY WAYS THAT REPUTATION IS
WELL DESERVED. THIS IS A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT WE COULD TAKE TO RESTORE A LITTLE BIT OF TRUST AND BE A STEP IN
THE DIRECTION OF GOOD GOVERNMENT. SO I'M HOPING IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET THE REQUISITE SIGNATURES
SHORT OF LEADERSHIP AGREEING TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR AND THEN WE CAN GET IT PASSED AND SIGNED
INTO LAW.
MR. SPEAKER, I RISE AGAIN TODAY TO ADVOCATE FOR AN END TO THE REDISTRICTING WAR THAT HAS BEEN
CASCADING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I'VE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THAT WOULD SAY WE SHOULD NOT HAVE MID DECADE REDISTRICTING, IT SHOULD
NOT BE DONE IN ANY STATE. AND I OPPOSED WHAT HAPPENED IN
TEXAS TO GERRYMANDER THAT STATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DECADE, AND I OPPOSED WHAT'S HAPPENED IN
CALIFORNIA. I'VE OPPOSED THE EFFORTS THAT'S AFOOT IN OTHER STATES, AND I APPLAUD THE DECISION BY THE
INDIANA STATE SENATE TO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH A MID DECADE GERRYMANDER IN A FAIRLY
OVERWHELMING VOTE YESTERDAY. THE FACT IS THAT GERRYMANDERING
IS AN AFFRONT TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT AND TO DEMOCRACY. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW
RUNS AGAINST THE DESIRES OF MEMBERS OF THIS BODY ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE AND CERTAINLY RUNS CONTRARY TO WHAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY.
I HAVE CALLED UPON THE LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE FOR MONTHS TO BRING THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR OR TO OTHERWISE REACH AN
ARMISTICE IN THIS REDISTRICTING WAR. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP, FRANKLY ON BOTH
SIDES, TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
AND AS I WARNED MONTHS AGO, THE WHOLE THING IS BASICALLY TURNING OUT TO BE A WASH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE VARIOUS
ELECTION FORECASTERS, THEY SAY YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO SEE EITHER SIDE REALLY GAIN
MUCH. SO ALL OF THIS EFFORT, ALL OF THIS MONEY, ALL OF THIS
POLITICAL CAPITAL SPENT REDRAWING MAPS, UPENDING THE
DISTRICTS OF DOZENS OF OUR MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, AND TO WHAT END?
NOTHING GOOD IS COMING FOR IT. MAYBE IF THE SPEAKER -- AND I
CANNOT LET THE MINORITY LEADER OFF THE HOOK EITHER BECAUSE HE'S BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THESE
EFFORTS, HAD BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON, LET'S SAY, HEALTH CARE POLICY THAN TRYING TO REDRAW
DISTRICT MAPS, WE WOULDN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE NOW WE'RE THREE WEEKS AWAY FROM AMERICANS SEEING
A MASSIVE INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. SO I'M AGAIN CALLING FOR MY BILL
TO BAN MID DECADE REDISTRICTING TO BE BROUGHT TO THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE, AND I'M ALSO WORKING ON
LEGISLATION TO END GERRYMANDERING IN THIS COUNTRY ONCE AND FOR ALL BY ASSURING THAT EVERY STATE HAS AN
INDEPENDENT COMMISSION MUCH LIKE THE ONE WE HAD IN CALIFORNIA UNTIL RECENTLY. I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE THAT
STEP TO END GERRYMANDERING, TO HAVE FAIR MAPS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY, THEN IT WILL RESTORE POWER WHERE IT BELONGS, AND THAT IS TO THE VOTERS THEMSELVES.
MR. SPEAKER, AS CHAIR OF THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT COVERS K-12 EDUCATION, I LIKE TO HAVE
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND VISIT HIGH-PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS, TO SEE THE LESSONS WE CAN LEARN.
THIS MORNING I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT A K.I.P. SCHOOL, KNOWLEDGE
IS POWER PROGRAM, HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.. THERE ARE 20K.I.P. SCHOOLS IN D.C. AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY
MORE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, INCLUDING MANY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS A TRULY
HIGH-PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK THAT TENDS TO ENROLL STUDENTS WHO ARE BELOW THE
POVERTY LEVEL THAT OPERATE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND YET THAT HAS OUTSTANDING RESULTS BY
ANY MEASURE BY STUDENT TEST SCORES, BY GRADUATION RATES AND BY THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO GO
TO COLLEGE. THEY REALLY HAVE BEEN KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE PARK FOR YEARS,
LIKE THE SUCCESS ACADEMY THAT OPERATES IN NEW YORK CITY AND I HAD A CHANCE TO VISITS ONE OF THEIR CAMPUSES MONTHS AGO.
IF THEY WERE CONSIDERED ONE OF THEIR OWN SCHOOL DISTRICTS, THEY LITERALLY WOULD BE THE HIGHEST
PERFORMING SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. SO THESE EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS
ARE, UNFORTUNATELY, NOT THE NORM WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC EDUCATION TODAY AND IN
PARTICULAR, IN MY STATE IN CALIFORNIA. THE LATEST NATION'S REPORT CARD SHOWED THAT STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT
IS AT AN ALL TIME LOW IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE NOT BOUNCED BACK TO EVEN
WHERE WE WERE PRIOR TO THE COVID YEARS. WE CONTINUE TO FALL BEHIND OUR
PEER NATIONS IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT FOR OUR STUDENTS. IN CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR,
WE'VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ALMOST $40 BILLION MORE THAT IS NOW
SPENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ON EDUCATION, AND WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?
U.C. SAN DIEGO, WHICH IS A PRETTY HIGH RANKING SCHOOL RECENTLY CAME OUT AND SAID THAT
THEIR STUDENTS, THEIR INCOMING STUDENTS ARE NOT PREPARED TO DO BASIC MATH. EVEN THE MOST BASIC MATH.
THEY HAVE HAD TO NOW PUT ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT STUDENTS INTO
REMEDIAL MATH COURSES AND EXPAND THE REMEDIAL COURSES THEY OFFER TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE REMEDIAL.
THAT IS THE RESULT OF A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT'S DONE
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO QUASH HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOLS
LIKE THE ONES I MENTIONED, SUCCESS ACADEMY, AND K.I.P., AND INSTEAD SUPPORT, PROP UP A
FAILING EDUCATION MODEL, THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE ASSIGNED TO ONE SCHOOL IN YOUR ZIP CODE
WHETHER IT IS GOOD OR BAD, WHETHER IT TEACHES STUDENTS TO READ OR DO MATH OR NOT.
SO IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT I HAVE THE HONOR TO CHAIR, WE HAVE
BEEN FOCUSING ON BOTH THE PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION IN AMERICA.
AND I THINK THERE IS A GREAT DEAL TO LEARN FROM SCHOOLS LIKE
K.I.P. AND SUCCESS ACADEMY WHICH SET HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENTS WHICH TEACH LITERACY
AND NUMERACY THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE TAUGHT, THAT HAVE
HIGH LEVELS IN EXPECTATIONS FOR THEIR TEACHERS AND HELP PREPARE THEM AS THEY NEED TO BE PREPARED
WHEN IT COMES TO PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, AND TO FOCUS LIKE A
LASER ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND ENGAGING PARENTS AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH GIVING STUDENTS
ACCESS TO A QUALITY EDUCATION. PROGRAMS LIKE THESE, SCHOOLS
LIKE THESE SHOW THAT EVERY CHILD IN THIS COUNTRY CAN INDEED SUCCEED. AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT A MATTER
OF GREAT URGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA HAS
THAT OPPORTUNITY.
MR. SPEAKER, I WILL BE INTRODUCING IN THE HOUSE THE RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION ACT,
WHICH IS A MEASURE THAT HAS BECOME NECESSARY IN ORDER TO
ASSURE THAT DISTRICTS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT DENIED REPRESENTATION HERE IN THE HOUSE. WE RECENTLY HAD A PERIOD OF TIME
IN CAN A NEWLY ELECTED MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF ARIZONA WAS NOT SEATED AS A MEMBER FOR WEEK
AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK FOR WHAT I BELIEVE WAS A RECORD PERIOD OF
TIME, DESPITE THE FACT SHE HAD WON HER ELECTION, THE ELECTION HAD BEEN CERTIFIED, AND THE DISTRICT WAS GOING WITHOUT
REPRESENTATION UNTIL SHE WAS SEATED. NOW, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES WAS NOT HERE AT THAT TIME WHICH ITSELF WAS A BIG PROBLEM THAT THE HOUSE CANCELED
ITS SESSIONS SIX WEEKS ON END WHILE THE GOVERNMENT WAS SHUT DOWN. BUT NEVERTHELESS, THIS MEMBER,
MS. GRIJALVA FROM ARIZONA COULD HAVE BEEN SWORN IN DURING WHAT'S CALLED
I THINK THIS IS SIMPLY WRONG. THAT SHE HAD TO WAIT OVER A
MONTH I BELIEVE AFTER SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SWORN IN TO BEGIN REPRESENTING HER CONSTITUENTS.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN REGARDLESS OF WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE HOUSE, REGARDLESS
WHICH PARTY THE MEMBER IS REPRESENTING. MY BILL WOULD SAY AFTER AN
INDIVIDUAL HAS PREVAILED MANY A SPECIAL ELECTION, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SWORN IN ON THE NEXT
LEGISLATIVE DAY, WHETHER A PRO FORMA SESSION OR REGULAR SESSION. THIS IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE
AND SO WE DON'T SEE IT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM ARIZONA EVER HAPPEN IN THIS
CHAMBER AGAIN.
MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE AND CONGRATULATE CHEF
BRIAN ESTES OF THE PLACER FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO IS RETIRING AT
THE END OF THIS YEAR AFTER AN EXCEPTIONAL CAREER OVER 35 YEARS IN THE FIRE SERVICE.
IN 1991, CHIEF GRADUATED AT THE TOP OF HIS CLASS FROM THE BUTTE

FIREFIGHTER IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND FOUR YEARS HE JOINED A
HELICOPTER UNIT AND STAYED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. HE HELD VARIOUS LEADERSHIP SUCH AS MANAGER, MILITARY HELICOPTER
MANAGER AND COORDINATED WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD ASLY
ACEON OFFICER. HE WAS PROMOTED TO FIRE APPARATUS ENGINEER.
BRIAN CLIMBED THE LADDER AND PROMOTED THROUGH THE RANKS BECOMING CAPTAIN IN 2000 AND
BATTALION CHIEF IN 2005. CHIEF RESPONDED TO CALIFORNIA'S MOST CHALLENGING FIRES LEADING
14 TYPE ONE INCIDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS TYPE ONE INCIDENT
COMMANDER. HE CONTINUED TO PROMOTE AND SERVED AS ASSISTANT CHIEF OF

REFLECTING HIS ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE THEIR POTENTIAL AND BRING OUT THE BEST IN THOSE HE
LEADS. A LIFELONG PUBLIC SERVANT, HE IS TRULY A PILLAR OF OUR COMMUNITY,
DEFINED BY HIS CONSISTENT ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT AND DEEP DEDICATION
TO THOSE HE SERVES GOING BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY. IT HAS BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO WORK
ALONG SIDE CHIEF ESTES THROUGHOUT MY TIME IN OFFICE AND
SOMEONE WHO IS HELD IN HIGHEST TEAM. THEREFORE, ON BEHALF OF THE
UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND CALIFORNIA'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT I
WISH CHIEF ESTES A HAPPY RETIREMENT AND THANK HIM FOR HIS MANY YEARS OF SERVICE.
I YIELD BACK. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN YIELDS.
UNDER THE SPEAKER'S ANNOUNCED POLICY OF JANUARY 3, 2025, THE
CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN FROM WISCONSIN, MR. GROTHMAN, FOR 30 MINUTES.
MR. GROTHMAN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS WE ADJOURN FOR THE WEEKEND I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THREE
ISSUES WHICH AFFECT AMERICANS ARE ISSUES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN
DISCUSSED QUITE AS MUCH AS WE OUGHT TO. THE FIRST ISSUE CONCERNS THIS
TRANSGENDER SITUATION. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT GUYS IN GIRLS SPORTS WHICH
IS A PROBLEM THAT OUGHT TO BE DEALT WITH AND POLLS VERY WELL,
BUT MORE OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IS OUT OF CONTROL PSYCHIATRIC
PROFESSION TREATING THIS AS A GENETIC PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE
TO HAVE SURGERIES TO DEAL WITH THIS. AND THEY HAVE SURGERIES ON YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE AS YOUNG AS 16 OR
15 OR 14 YEARS OLD, SURGERIES THAT WILL AFFECT THEM. JUST AS BAD, THEY GIVE PUB EARTH
BLOCKERS NOT KNOWING WHAT THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS WILL BE.
RECENTLY NEW INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE COME AS A SURPRISE TO NO ONE BUT WILL BE A SURPRISE
TO THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA, A NEW STUDY CAME OUT SHOWING YOUNG
ADULTS IDENTIFYING AS TRANSGENDER PLUNGES BY NEARLY A HALF IN TWO YEARS EXPOSING WHAT
WE KNOW ALL LONG IT IS A SOCIAL ISSUE. IT IS NOT A GENETIC DISEASE THAT
REQUIRED SURGERIES OR PERMANENTLY CHANGING PEOPLES'
LIVES. THIS AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES WHO HAVE PEW BERT
BLOCKERS, IT AFFECTS THE PARENTS, THE GRANDCHILDREN, THE PARENTS WHO WILL NEVER HAVE
GRANDCHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN WERE ROPED INTO THIS BY THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA, BY THE
LIBERAL PSYCHIATRIC, PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS, BY HOSPITALS WHO MAKE MONEY OFF
THIS DEAL. I AM AFRAID THAT THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM THAT SHOULD
BE DEALT WITH IN CONGRESS AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DEALT WITH SOON, IN WHICH WE BEGIN TO
REFUSE THIS SORT OF TREATMENT AND EVEN MORE, REFUSE THE SURGERIES TO PEOPLE, LET'S SAY
UNDER THE AGE OF 21. CAN ANYBODY HONESTLY SAY THAT YOU WOULD ADVISE SOMEONE WHO IS
20 OR 19 YEARS OLD NOT TO OR TO HAVE SURGERY PERMANENTLY
ALTERING YOUR BODY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? THAT I HOW YOUR IDEAS IN LIFE
HAVE CHANGED, YOUR OPINIONS ON LIFE HAVE CHANGED BETWEEN WHEN YOU'RE 18 OR 19 OR 20 YEARS OLD
AND WHEN YOU ARE 45 OR 50 YEARS OLD. BUT THE KNOW IT ALLS ARE
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO HAVE SURGERIES, ARE GIVING PEOPLE
PUBERTY BLOCKERS. I HOPE OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM IN THE NEAR FUTURE PUTS SOMETHING
FORWARD THAT SAYS -- AND REALLY SHOULD BE GREATER THAN THAT, YOU
CAN'T BE A CONGRESSMAN UNTIL AGE 25 BUT AT LEAST UNTIL AGE 21,
PUTS AN END TO THIS AND PUTS AN END TO THE PSYCHIATRIC,
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS. THAT'S ONE ISSUE. AND THIS DEALS WITH SOCIAL
SECURITY, RIGHT NOW THERE ARE OLDER PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE MISTAKE OF RETIRING AND GETTING
SOCIAL SECURITY AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND MAKE SOME MORE MONEY AND THEY ARE
ABLE TO. EARLIER THIS SESSION WE PLAYED AROUND A LITTLE BIT WITH THE
SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND OR THE END OF THE LAST SESSION IN
WHICH WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE VOTED FOR GIVING MORE SOCIAL SECURITY
DOLLARS TO GOVERNMENTAL EMPLOYEES, ABOUT $24 BILLION A YEAR. RATHER THAN ENCOURAGING MORE
PEOPLE TO RETIRE, IF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM WANTS TO ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO WORK, WHICH WE SHOULD, WE SHOULD
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT A SENIOR CAN MAKE BEFORE
THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY IS TAKEN AWAY. RIGHT NOW, IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN
$19, 500 UNDER SOCIAL SECURITY, WHEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT, THE
GOVERNMENT BEGINS TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK. RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS
OF TRYING TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM WORKING IF THEY ARE 68 OR
69 OR 70. LET'S PASS THE SENIOR INDEPENDENCE ACT, WHICH INCREASES THAT AMOUNT FROM 19,
500 TO 30,000 SO THAT THE OLDER PEOPLE WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY AND EVEN MORE IT'S
GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO WORK, IF THESE OLDER PEOPLE WANT TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE, GET A LITTLE
MORE SOCIAL STIMULATION BY WORKING, THEY ARE NOT PENALIZED
FOR DOING SO. I ENCOURAGE OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM. I REALIZE THAT THEY'LL SAY THAT
IT WILL ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO RETIRE EARLY AND MIGHT COST THE
GOVERNMENT A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. BUT WE HAVE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RETIRE LAST JANUARY. LET'S ENCOURAGE AND FREE UP
OLDER PEOPLE AND LET THEM WORK A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A LABOR
SHORTAGE. SO IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY AS WE SEE A FEW MORE
PEOPLE GOING TO WORK, MAYBE WORKING 30 HOURS A WEEK, INSTEAD
OF WORKING 20 HOURS A WEEK. AND LIKE I SAID, WE WANT TO
BOOST OUR ECONOMY A LITTLE. THRR SO MANY RETAIL OUTLETS OUT
THERE AND FACTORIES WHO ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR SOME MORE LABOR PARTICULARLY AS WE
ARE FINALLY KICKING SOME OUT OF THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, IT WOULD
BE GREAT TO HAVE MORE 68 OR
69-YEAR-OLDS AND I HOPE OUR LEADERSHIP WILL PASS THE SENIOR INDEPENDENCE ACT AND ALLOW
SENIORS TO MAKE $30,000 A YEAR. NOW THE THIRD ISSUE I WANT TO
DEAL WITH COMES UNDER 14-C, WHICH IS THE PROVISION THAT
ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE -- HAVE
SOME PHYSICAL PLOBS, SPINA
BIFATA, DOWN SYNDROME, OTHERS,
PARAPLEDGEICS, TO WORK AND GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION IN ORDER TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY VIABLE TO
HAVE THEM WORK, THEY HAVE TO WORK FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE. NOBODY EVER FORCES PEOPLE TO DO
THIS, BUT THEY DO IT TO EARN A LITTLE ADDITIONAL MONEY. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ON
S.S.I. AND DON'T NEED MONEY TO PAY THE MORTGAGE OR RENT BUT WOULD LIKE TO BUY SOME CLOTHES,
PERHAPS BUY GIFTS FOR PARENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU, AND THEY ARE
MISGUIDED PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET RID OF 14-C
CERTIFICATETIVE INDICATES AND MAKE IT AGAINST THE LAW TO PAY
$4, $5 OR $6 OUT THERE. I HAVE FORMED A CAUCUS FOR --
CALLED THE DISBUILT EMPLOYMENT CAUCUS, WHICH IS DEDICATED TO
THE DEDICATION OF THE 14-C PROGRAM AND PROVIDE STRUCTURE TO
THE EFFORT TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT
DISABILITIES TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO WORK FOR A LITTLE BIT SMALLER AMOUNT.
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE THAT SOME PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE AWAY THIS FREEDOM. I BELIEVE IN COUNTIES IN WHICH
THIS FREEDOM HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT NOW WORKING FOR $4, $5
AN HOUR WORK IN DAY SERVICES AND SIT AROUND AND WATCH TELEVISION OR MAYBE THEY ARE TAKEN ON A
TRIP TO SOMEWHERE, BUT THEY MISS OUT ON THE ENJOYMENT OF WORK. THEY MISS OUT ON BEING LIKE
THEIR SIBLINGS IN WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO GO TO WORK TODAY AND TO
A DEGREE TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT IS TRAGIC WHEN THAT IS DONE AND THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF
THE FREEDOM TO WORK. I WILL ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO TRACK DOWN ANY
14-C EMPLOYERS IN THEIR DISTRICT AND SEE MEANINGFUL IT IS FOR
THESE PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO WORK AND TO BE ABLE TO EARN THEIR OWN
MONEY. AND IT'S NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC DECISION, IT'S A SOCIAL DECISION AS WELL.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SCARES PARENTS OR GUARDIANS WHO ARE
DEALING WITH PEOPLE IN THIS SITUATION IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THEM WHEN THE PARENTS
ARE GONE, ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS, ARE THEY GOING TO HAVE ANY SOCIAL STRUCTURE.
AND EVEN MORE WITH PEOPLE IN OTHER JOBS, THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE
PROVIDED BY PEOPLE IN EMPLOYERS THAT USE 14 CERTIFICATES DOES
PROVIDE THESE FOLKS WITH FRIENDS, WE ALL TO THE EXTENT
SOCIALIZE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THESE PEOPLE, IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE FRIENDS OUTSIDE THEIR
IMMEDIATE FAMILY. AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SHUT DOWN THESE EMPLOYERS, YOU ARE
DEPRIVING THESE PEOPLE OF THE GREPS -- FRIENDSHIPS THEY WILL
INFORM THAT GIVE 14-C. WE ALL TO GET RE-ELECTED,
RIGHT -- I BEG MY COLLEAGUES TO TOUR FACILITIES WHO HAVE 14-C
CERTIFICATES AND SEE HOW HAPPY THE PEOPLE ARE THAT WORK THERE AND SEE HOW IMPORTANT
ECONOMICALLY AS WELL AS SOCIALLY IT IS FOR THESE FOLKS TO HAVE
THE FREEDOM TO WORK IN THESE FACILITIES. . .
AND I HOPE CONGRESS STANDS UP TO THE FREEDOM HATERS WHO WANT TO DENY THESE FOLKS THE ABILITY TO
WORK IN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SETTING THAT THEY WANT TO DO.
SO THERE ARE THREE ISSUES THAT I ASK CONGRESS TO TAKE UP AND
CONSIDER. I WANT CONGRESS TO PASS WHATEVER LEGISLATION IS NECESSARY TO MAKE
SURE WE ALWAYS PROTECT THE 14-C
CERTIFICATES. I ASK CONGRESS TO TAKE UP
RAISING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY A SENIOR CAN MAKE BEFORE WE TAKE AWAY THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY, BOTH
FOR THE GOOD OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY, AS WELL AS FOR BOTH THE
FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL HELP -- SOCIAL ASSISTANCE OF OUR SENIOR
CITIZENS. AND FINALLY, I ASK CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THESE
OUT-OF-CONTROL, LACK OF COMMONSENSE PSYCHIATRISTS-PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE AT LEAST NOT ABLE TO GIVE
PUBERTY BLOCKERS ON SURGERIES ON PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 21. AND LIKE I SAID, I THINK WE SHOULD BAN IT EVEN ABOVE THAT
AMOUNT, IT'S CERTAINLY SAD AND I'VE HEARD PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY REGRET THEIR SURGERIES BUT IT SEEMS IN OUR SOCIETY, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO DRINKING, WHEN IT
COMES DOWN TO SMOKING, AGE 21 IS A LIMIT IN WHICH WE ALLOW PEOPLE
TO DO MORE. IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WANT TO INTRODUCE AN AMENDMENT TO
H.R. 25, OUR FOREFATHERS DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE QUALIFIED TO BE CONGRESSMEN UNTIL WE WERE AGE
25, I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO FOR AN AGE 25 LIMIT AS WELL BUT I'D LIKE TO BE DEBATING THAT IN CONFERENCE NEXT WEEK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: DOES THE GENTLEMAN YIELD BACK? MR. GROTHMAN: YES. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: DOES THE GENTLEMAN HAVE A MOTION? MR. GROTHMAN: YES. MR. SPEAKER, I MOVE THAT THE
HOUSE DOES NOW ADJOURN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE QUESTION IS ON THE MOTION TO ADJOURN. THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. THOSE OPPOSED, NO.
THE AYES HAVE IT. THE MOTION IS ADOPTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE HOUSE STANDS ADJOURNED UNTIL NOON ON MONDAY
NEXT FOR MORNING HOUR DEBATE.
